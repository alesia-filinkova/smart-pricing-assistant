I have been to Amsterdam many times and so can say quite honestly this is a fabulous, clean, well decorated and spacious apartment with everything you should possibly need in a great area for shopping, eating and drinking. The flat is also extremely close to the train station and so very easy to get to by foot.
<br/>Joanna was very welcoming and kindly allowed us a flexible check in and we were allowed to leave our bags when we checked out to collect later on in the day.  Joanna is also full of ideas of places to go should you need any direction - especially places to eat!  
<br/>Amsterdam is a wonderful city and staying here only enhances a wonderful experience, I would definitely recommend staying here - just be warned yes the stairs are steep but are definitely manageable just be careful with your luggage and you shouldn't have any problems at all. 
<br/>Thanks Joanna we will definitely be back - the only problem will be finding a time they aren't booked up!",5.0

My wife and I were made to feel welcome from the very first moment we arrived. We were introduced to Reinharts son and shown to our room. As first timers to nocarz, we were a little bit nervous at the prospect of staying in someones home... whilst they were home but we settled in in no time at all as Reinhart was practically invisible wilst we were there. That said, if you needed anything, he was there in a flash... even letting me use his laptop and printer to check in for our return flight allowing us a relaxing experience at Schipol. As for the area itself, it is located literally 5 minutes from the hustle and bstle of Amsterdam city centre and the Red Light District, bars, coffe shops etc. That said, once you get on that free ferry that runs every few minutes, 24 hours a day (and is always strangely full regardless of the time), you arrive into a different world. We awoke each morning to a lovely heron, some swand, ducks and moorhens. The sceenry was second to none. The accomodations itself were impeccibly clean and the bed was properly comfortable.

We were able to drop our bags off in the morning and Matt allowed me to get changed in their personal bathroom following an early flight. He gave us the keys and told us to come back anytime after 1pm. Matt gave us recommendations for food and places which was appreciated. <br/>The room was lovely as shown in the photos with a shared bathroom - we did not see the other guest but could hear them going in and out of the bathroom and with their keys rattling in the mornings. However I am a light sleeper so this may well be why. There were a few times when I would go to use the bathroom and the toilet had been left in a mess, again this is down to the other guest not the hosts. <br/>Location wise we found the apartment great. Only a 10 minute tram into the centre and the tram stop is basically a couple of steps away from the front door, very easy to use the trams too. There are some lovely little cafes and restaurants on the street for brunch type food. <br/>Overall we loved our stay with Matt at Rosie’s place and would recommend for anyone looking for good value for money.",

Eline very kindly lent us her espresso machine when the one in the flat didn't work. It's a great place with character, very spacious, an old house with new & modern finish. Very accessible to central station & the historic centre.

<br/>As it only has a small microwave/oven, it could be a prob if you stay longer and plan to cook. It's a nice and quiet area, but if you like lying in like us, then be prepared to be woken up by the noise of the kids during their play time close by.

<br/>It has many old elements,well painted  and is high on atmosphere. The kitchen and the main sleeping room are especially worth mentioning here. Never imagined one can sleep that well on a boat. 
<br/>Whilst we never met the owner, he offered a very customised list of nice things to do in the neighborhood, keeping well in mind that we have two small kids. Furthermore, he left the key in a cafe ( first drinks on him) , he left some beers and some food in the fridge for us.

My husband could not sleep the first 2 nights because of the loud church bells ringing every hour - 2 sleeping tablets helped the 3rd night. The 48 steep steps will not suit everyone.

The surrounding neighborhood had a lot of popular and well-reviewed bars and restaurants, and it was almost literally right next to the Heineken Experience, if you're interested in that.

<br/>There were some minor downsides to the apartment, such as the steep staircase (which we assume is typical and we didn't have too much of a problem with, but others might) and some uncomfortable springs in the couch and the bed.

Bus stop was really close, a nice cafe at the corner, a grocery store close by, and the apartment was just enough off from the bigger street to be nicely quiet. ",

Breakfast at her place is a good time to interact with guests from the other room who may give you some recommendations to do around the city. Definitely an interaction and experience one may not get from staying in a hotel. Tram is almost right at the door step and takes about 15 mins to get to the central which is really convenient as it passes by most of the main areas like Dam square and museumplein. However, do note that the walls are thin and you can hear the movements outside your room. If you can live with that, her place will be a great place to stay!",5.0

,,,30311864.0,"Marion and Jang’s home is the best nocarz decision I have made to date. <br/>Location: Their home is a bit outside of the city center, tucked into a cozy little neighborhood and close to an old shipping warf which has a few great restaurants and access to the ferries. It’s just far enough to escape the crowds but not far enough to feel like you’re missing anything. Getting to the center is easy - it’s a short (free!) walk-on ferry away. It’s also a bike ride away from some beautiful Dutch countryside. Our favorite day during our trip was the day we spent touring the countryside/coast per Marion and Jang’s recommendation!<br/>The home: the bedroom is small, but perfect for two people. There’s a great library just off of the bedroom that acts as a living room but we were lucky to have perfect weather so honestly didn’t use it much. <br/>The hosts: Marion and Jang are truly the best. They went far above and beyond to make us feel at home and to help us have the most amazing time in Amsterdam. We were there for 5 days and every day Marion or Jang (or both of them) would make us an excellent breakfast and we would sit in their beautiful garden where they would provide us suggestions and answer all of our first-timer questions. We had planned very little before arriving in Amsterdam (intentionally) and thoroughly enjoyed everything they suggested. They let us use their bikes for 5 euro per day which was SO great. We spent more time on those bikes than we did on our feet. The convenience of being able to ride the bikes back to the place we were staying and then just grabbing them again in the morning before heading out was wonderful. <br/>I can’t recommend this place enough. If you’re looking to avoid some of the hustle of the center but still have easy access, be in close proximity to the country side, eat a wonderful homemade breakfast every morning, and get to know two of the loveliest people on the planet, then do yourself a favor and stay here.

It was that time of the month for my girlfriend and unfortunately the bed sheets got stained. Karlijn ended up charging us for the sheets without even attempting to wash it first. As a guest, it just doesn't feel right that we are responsible for stained sheets because: 1) Hotels would never have such a requirement. 2) There was no explicit mention on the listing that guests are responsible for stained sheets. 3a) There was a cleaning fee, I assume that fee is used for cleaning such as laundering the sheets. 3b) If the cleaning fee does not include laundering the sheets then what does it actually cover. 3c) We view ourselves as clean people: Even though there was a cleaning fee, we did wash the dishes and make the bed. 4) I did some research on how other nocarz hosts handle this situation and it does look like the general consensus is to treat it as a cost of doing business: Jennifer (Windham, CT) https://tinyurl.com/y9mk5jaz, Linda (La Quinta, CA) https://tinyurl.com/y7uyb39a, David (Como, CO) https://tinyurl.com/ya9na739 5) From Karlijn's messages to the resolution request, I don’t think she even tried to clean the sheets (EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A CLEANING FEE): Karlijn’s message to me on nocarz: ""Hey David, Just got home. The house looks clean. Only the sheet and matrass cover are really dirty. I will try to wash them first, but if they dont get cleaned I would like to ask you to pay for new ones. They were from IKEA so not too expensive.” Jan 1, 9:25 AM Funds Request for Replacement Sheets: Jan 1, 12:27 PM From the time she got back to the her apartment to take a look around to the time she took pictures and requested replacement sheets were 3 hours apart. I don’t believe she even tried to clean the sheets. 6) Karlijn said: ""I have a washing machine in my apartment that they could have used, David and his girlfriend however decided to put in a corner for me the resolve the incident.“ Jan 2, 11:21 AM Again, as a guest, I assumed the cleaning fee includes laundering the sheets. Again, there was no explicit mention that we needed to clean the apartment after our stay. 7) After I declined her request for funds, she is now mentioning other small things like we did not take out the trash: ""In addition, even though I have a bin next to my toilet, they stuffed a small bin in the bathroom with dirty pads to the extend that the lit did not even fit. I understand that they do not have to clean the garbage, but I am also a bit surprised they do not seem even slightly embarrased by the whole incident. I personally would have thrown it away in the garbage outside my house and contacted the host to ask what to do.” Jan 2, 11:21 AM For goodness sake, we...",5.0

The houseboat was fastidiously clean and extremely comfortable. It was an easy walk to public transportation which allowed us to see the entire city. The host provided wonderful goodies (the coffee, stroopwaffles, cheeses and wine) and beautiful tulips that were greatly appreciated. We also enjoyed opening up the huge sliding windows while watching the boats going up and down the canal. It was one of the most relaxing and exciting vacations we have ever been on...when the urge to go somewhere struck us it was easy to get there...and when we wanted to relax, your houseboat was the perfect place to relax.

We didn’t appreciate being pre warned on more than one occasion about the house rules, especially when we hadn’t even arrived in Amsterdam and Miriam was already sending me messages like “if we step out of line, she’ll need to take action”, we aren’t little children for you to treat us like this we are responsible adults. Maybe don’t put your apartment on nocarz during ADE if you’re so concerned. You have no idea what type of people we are so jumping to conclusions was not very nice. Also, the issue with the door, maybe you should be at the apartment to show your guests how to properly shut the door so your neighbors don’t get upset. We closed the door properly every single time we left the building and made sure of it. Lastly, the disgusting smell from bathroom was very unpleasant and spread throughout the entire apartment. It smelt like it was coming from the sewer and you said you had sent someone to take a look but they didn’t do anything, the smell was still very bad throughout our entire stay. The bathroom and kitchen weren’t clean at all, the kitchen bench was dirty and the kitchenware wasn’t washed. The bathroom had old hairs all over and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned properly. Also, think about providing some hand towels for your guests, especially if they’re staying for 8 nights or more.

Derek and Iman were friendly and helpful whenever I bumped into them but we rarely encountered one another.  It is just a bed, there's no desk, tv, kitchen facilities other than a kettle, so you will have to go out.  But the location is close to the city centre, almost directly opposite the maritime museum, well worth a visit (and the hotel within the naval complex, Homeland, is good for breakfast).  Nonetheless these eastern dockland islands are generally quieter, more residential, than the inner canals.  And if you're interested in the history of Amsterdam as a naval and commercial port, Kattenburg and the next door islands which were the home of the Dutch East India Company, were at the heart of it.  I'd recommend Sotto pizzeria on the Kadijksplein, a short walk away, and Olijfje (Turkish) a bit further away on Valkenburgerstraat, and for a drink the Groene Olifant on Sarphatistraat.",5.0

For convenience, we purchased a 72 hour transport pass at the airport before we took the train to Waterlooplein.  The studio was ready for us and Rini had provided everything we needed in the way of milk, eggs, cheese and fresh fruit.  We found two excellent restaurants within walking distance - Il Canto at #2 Amstel and Harmsen's on Utrechtstrasse.  A great bakery ""Bake My Day"" is a 5 minute walk across the bridge.

So, if you want the freedom to talk (at a conversational volume) after, say, 10:30/11pm... something you'll probably want to do after a long day of exploring a beautiful city so you can compare notes with each other and just share your excitement from the day, this is NOT the home for you to stay in. Our host cost us hundreds of dollars by kicking us out twice and changing her mind both times because she isn't able to handle even the smallest amount of noise after a certain hour. We did not yell, play loud music, or do any stomping around, but even so, it was too much and she contacted me at midnight demanding we be out by the morning.

The place was perfectly located among many shops & restaurants in addition to being close to many major attractions around town.  Everything is in close walking proximity.  The Rembrandt house is 5 min away, Train station 10 min and other major attractions 10-15 min.  It was nice to have the local grocery store just around the corner and they did take credit cards which was not the case at many others around town.  The room is open with two beds, tv, shower, bathroom, etc but the best part was the cozy terrace where we spent time having drinks at night or coffee early in the morning.  Lastly, our 2.5yr old had fun with the cat in the house that would come visit.  Overall, we'd highly recommend staying here and look forward to going back.",

It's much quieter than the downtown area, but public transportation is super accessible so it's still easy to get around.<br/>The only issues we had were with the shower, and with check-in.  Since Irene uses a third-party to manage the nocarz, we were communicating with another person to be let in, and they ended up being over an hour late.  We had to sit on a curb during a really bad heatwave while we waited.  At least the person was very apologetic, which helped make up for the wait.  As far as the shower, whenever we would flush the toilet, it would back up.  This meant the whole nocarz smelt like sewage.  Since the place is a historic building, there are no windows that open, meaning we had to just deal with the smell.  They were able to send someone out to fix it the next day, but it ended up backing up again later that day.

Sun was very helpful with check in and recommended us a nice place for our first dinner. The place is clean with spacious (for European standard) shower. The big windows helped with the Amsterdam gloomy weather and the complimentary coffee/tea paired well with a relaxing morning out on the rooftop. Even though the place is deep in the Canal Belt, Uber can pickup/drop off most of the time if you don't feel like walking, however, beware of traffic during rush hour. Another note is just like all other Amsterdam houses, this one has a very steep staircase. It's a fair tradeoff for the rooftop view but just make sure you're ready to walk the stairs.",5.0

We dealt with his neighbor/partner, Marcel.  Marcel was as rude a person as I've ever met. There are several rooms in this building and Marcel gave us completely incorrect instructions to our room inside the building and then made us feel stupid for his mistake!  Then when we came back later, we had a terrible time opening the outside door. It was our silly mistake. We simply turned the key left (like most locks in the U.S.) and it opens to the right. We finally figured it out and Marcel comes down the stairs and said "" Is the lock broken or just your brain?""  We couldn't believe he was speaking to us that way!  Then we looked back at the door incredulously and he said ""Staring at it won't make it work better!""  We were both dumbfounded!  <br/>One more thing... The room is a block from Westerkerk Church. The bells ring every 15 minutes all night long!  We didn't sleep a wink all night!",

Man ist zu Fuß schnell in der Stadt und erreicht öffentliche Verkehrsmittel und Museen fußläufig. Der Vondelpark ist quasi nebenan ebenso wie zahlreiche gute Cafés und Restaurants. Uns wurden zwei Fahrräder zur Verfügung gestellt und es gab zahlreiche Tipps für Ausflüge und Foodspots (großes Dankeschön an René - De Luwte war großartig!). Man hat gemerkt, dass die Nachbarschaft dort sehr eng miteinander ist und wir durften sozusagen ein Teil davon sein, was den ganzen Aufenthalt sehr viel „familiärer“ wirken lies.

Attention to detail was impressive and effective! Little touches like providing terrycloth bath slippers to combat the cold tile floors, earplugs to combat the noise from outside, and two layers of curtains to allow the level of light and privacy a person could want was impressive! Bigger touches like the great mattress, pre-programmed tablet with local info, and seamless check in and checkout via my phone we're excellent. I can't say enough good things about this place, but there are some people who will not like it because of the unusual closeness to the public outside. Some people will not like having a busy city street directly on the other side of their hotel room wall, and some people will be nervous about feeling secure, but I had no such issue. I loved the feeling of being so close to the people of Amsterdam, taking pictures of the bikers and boats outside my window, but I recognize that no amount of excellent design could counter the nervous feeling I know some folks would get.

Anyone with vertigo issues, be aware.<br/>-There was construction going on right outside the boat (that started at 7:30am each morning) that meant we had no outdoor seating place.  I wish we would have known this beforehand, I might have cancelled, as this was really the selling point for us.<br/>-There are at least 2 other boats docked in front of Casper's boat, and both of them are rust buckets filled with junk.  It certainly didn't add to the view.   In fact, there is no view to be had.  You can't see anything but the next rusty houseboat when looking out the portholes.<br/>-3 of the 4 windows on the ceiling leaked quite a bit when it rained one day.  <br/>-The place gets quite hot in the heat of the day.

Every detail in the apartment is stylish and you will love coming home to this place after spending the day walking around the beautiful city. Noortje’s communication was great leading up to the reservation as well as during our trip. Check-in/out was extremely simple. <br/>De Pijp is a fantastic area and Noortje’s place is located near trendy bars, restaurants and shops. It is a great neighborhood to explore and also very convenient to walk/cycle/public transport around the city. We really appreciated that Noortje left a detailed list of local recommendations and information about the apartment. We checked out and loved many of her recommendations. We also loved the bottle of wine that was perfect to enjoy on our jet lagged first night 😊.<br/>The one thing to note is that the bed is made up of two mattresses which are covered over by one top pad. I think for most this would not be a big deal, but for couples who sleep in the middle of the bed be prepared to manage feeling like you are in a “crack”. Noortje was totally forthcoming about the mattress situation when I asked before our stay. Other than that small thing, the bed is very comfortable and there are great blackout curtains to help you sleep in if you need to catchup on rest. I absolutely would still recommend staying in this place 100% and would happily return to this apartment during our next trip!",

From the moment you arrive at the location he is very helpful and makes you feel extremely comfortable. The guest house is located in a very tranquil area just out of Amsterdam and is the best place to come back to in the evening to relax after experiencing the busy and culturally/historically dense city centre. Mornings are equally relaxing as breakfast is fully stocked every day and you even get the chance to pick warm eggs laid by the on-site chickens. The rooms are brilliantly modern and equipped, maintaining the highes standards of cleanliness and care. I thoroughly recommend staying here if you are a family visiting Amsterdam or a couple who do not necessarily want to rest in the hustle and bustle of the city. Thanks a lot for a great stay Wilco!",

You cannot beat the location of Marit's apartment. Great restaurants all around; close to the tram line; a wonderful view of the city from her roof top deck; and a view of the canal from the front window that is hard to beat!

The check in instructions include stopping to get a key at a station that is nearly two kilometers away.

Additionally, after planning for this, we got a message to just meet the host at the nocarz to get the key and someone will meet us. Check out instructions include bringing the key back to the drop off location as well. Another step that is unnecessary for a day of travel. The space is compact, which is totally cool and works well. The bed however is rather loud with slight movement and keeps you up at night ( coming from someone who is a heavy sleeper)<br/>If you’re in a pinch, this space will work, however, there’s plenty of better options out there<br/>The pros of this space were the location.

The place is even better than depicted; it is very spacious (so much storage space!), with a modern industrial minimalist decor, and all the amenities you could wish for, including a smart TV and my favorite, a washer (and a convenient drying rack)! In terms of accessibility, there is a lift, no stairs in the apartment, and a walk-in shower. Houthavens is about a 7-10 minute drive from the Old town of Amsterdam, or about a smooth 15-20 min bicycle ride. We were there during Amsterdam Dance Event week, and were able to walk to a few events, including the infamous Gashouder :-) The apartment is 2 mins from a charming cafe, and about a 5-10 min walk to bars and restaurants.

Excellent design and planned out to make the most of every inch with clever use of lighting. It had everything we needed and more. The bathroom felt particularly luxurious! There was a nice little bench outside with tall planters to give a bit of screening/privacy. We were attending a music festival nearby, so near Sloterdijk station was a good central location. 1 train stop to Amsterdam's Central Station (5 mins) or 2 stops in the other direction to the airport. It was also only 8 mins to walk from the station, so easy enough to do with our trolley bags.  The best bit was the late checkout.

The studio is super clean and feels spacious, yet cozy. It was perfect for myself, my husband, and my dachshund Piper. It’s a nice, quiet residential area off the beaten path from Amsterdam central. It’s about a 25 minute walk to the ferry or there’s a bus line as well. The ferry is free and super easy to take to central station for exploring the city! We chose to walk to the ferry every day, which was definitely doable, but also long after a day of walking around the city. However it’s super easy to hop on the bus or book an Uber if you don’t want to walk. The surrounding area is under construction and in a few years I bet it will be super, super busy there when things are built up. There are a couple nice looking restaurants nearby and a really cute coffee shop that we frequented every day (Gentle Coffee). It was a wonderful stay!! Thank you!!",5.0
