A single Norwegian living in Amsterdam, I have a steady job and my own apartment with a guest room. I like hosting guests from all over the world, and have done so lots in the last few years. I'm a huge nerd who loves science and science fiction, and am very curious about the world around me. I like learning new things, making new friends and generally try to experience as much as I can. 

INTERESTS
I go to a gym, train kendo, do archery and pistol shooting. I like to go to concerts (all kinds of music), to cinemas (all kinds of movies), to play games (like chess or backgammon or poker, also more advanced board games), and to read books (all kinds, but sci-fi a big favorite).

We always go to the UK on holiday to go walking and fossiling on the beaches of the Jurassic Coast. 
Favorite tv series are MASH, Hill Street Blues, Morse, Great British Bake Off, Masterchef, Downton Abbey, anything British actually...  and many more of course.
Film: The Big Lebowski
We are vegetarians. Chiara loves to bake. Chiara and Ella do yoga. Tess is a little ballerina. Lottie is mainly being naughty. And Itse is a keen surfer and runner.
Chiara likes jazz, Itse not so much. He likes Coldplay, she not so much. We both like The Doors.
Happiness is not a destination but a way of life.",,,,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/29145151/profile_pic/1441741153/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/29145151/profile_pic/1441741153/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Oost,1.0,2.0,,t,t,"Amsterdam, Noord-Holland, Netherlands",IJburg - Zeeburgereiland,,52.35123,5.00032,,Entire home/apt,4.0,,,3.0,,"[""Free parking on premises"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Heating"", ""Washer"", ""Wifi"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Kitchen"", ""Essentials"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Dryer"", ""Shampoo""]",,,22.0,5.0,5.0,,22.0,5.0,22.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,2025-03-03,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,2016-01-03,2016-08-13,4.33,5.0,,5.0,4.0,,,03633EF2E084CE4F65E1,f,1.0,,0.0,,0.03

Living on Wooster Street I was a local for a week, a fantastic experience. I would love to offer this kind of experience to my guests when staying in Amsterdam.

The house is mainly occupied by me, my son and Bonnie the cat, but we love to entertain friends and family with food and stories, so the house can be quiet as well as very lively. A family home in short ;-)

Our room for rent is on the second floor of a 4 story house, and with it's own bathroom on the same floor, it is all rather private and relaxed, for the guests as well as us. We live on the two top floors, just a shout away if any help is needed. 
My personal interests are art, photography, film and design, and I love to show my guests the local hotspots. New shows and exhibitions, exciting places to go for shopping, coffee or food, I am happy to share if you want to know.
 
I travelled west as far as San Francisco and east as far as Varanasi. Both ways there was always a 'friend's connection' to help out with local stuff. This was before nocarz existed, and now through this organization I can maybe be that connection for you.

I believe that I am an openminded- easy going person that sees life as a journey without a destination where the journey itself is the most exciting experience!

Traveling became one of my passions after I experienced living abroad and when I travelled through Asia. This experience was an eyeopener and made me realize that being abroad and on the road is what I would live for from this day on.

Besides being an entrepreneur and a tech geek, I like to go sailing in the summer and snowboarding in the winter. I furthermore have a profound love for music and sports and I like to be with friends an family.

As a tenant I believe that being a guest anywhere is a privilege and therefore I am always grateful to the host. I would be above all respectful to the host and try to have a minimal impact on the offered accommodation.

I travelled over 70 countries and have a good idea what you need; a clean, warm and cosy place without to much distraction.
A warm shower and a place to prepare some food helps you to stay on your budget and in summer a little place to sit outside.

I love to meet people and talk about the way we fill in our daily life. Often we see that we have many things in common and yet we are so different.

I have many local tips, if you like to make the most of the free things Amsterdam has plenty to offer but you can also go all out as you can read in my local guidebook here on nocarz.

Feel free to ask me any questions and I'm sure to find an answer. I love to help you plan your trip.

Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/048d8039-0cfb-47ef-95d3-d3bd8597b760.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/User/original/048d8039-0cfb-47ef-95d3-d3bd8597b760.jpeg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,23.0,24.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,,Oud-Noord,,52.38652,4.91382,,Entire home/apt,2.0,1.0,1 bath,1.0,1.0,"[""Smart lock"", ""Canal view"", ""Waterfront"", ""Essentials"", ""Bed linens"", ""Self check-in"", ""City skyline view"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""AC - split type ductless system""]",$215.00,,99.0,1.0,2.0,99.0,99.0,1.0,99.0,,t,11.0,,46.0,,,102.0,21.0,1.0,,20.0,164.0,25256.0,2018-10-19,2025-02-18,4.68,,,4.76,,4.6,4.44,Exempt,t,23.0,5.0,12.0,0.0,

I'm Carry, a 35 year old woman from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I love to travel and I take every opportunity I get to go abroad! Besides traveling I enjoy being with friends, food, weight training, biking, nature, hiking, metal smithing, baking sweets and lots more.

In 2010 I have traveled through South America as a backpacker together with my sister for about 10 months and fell in love with the continent, especially with Argentina and Buenos Aires. I have been going back yearly and recently lived there for a couple of years as well. 
In 2016-2017 my sister and I lived and traveled in New Zealand with a working holiday visa, so that was another great adventure where we used nocarz regularly :)

I like to join this platform both as a host and a guest. When possible, I offer my apartment in Amsterdam to fellow travelers during my own holidays.

In my profile I said I speak Spanish, because I do understand most of it. I'm far from fluent though, especially my speech isn't good!

In case I’m abroad either my mother Regien or sister Belle will be your host and handle both the check-in and check-out. In that case their contact information will be available to you after booking.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, I'll be happy to answer :)

And in the afternoon we often enjoy a glass of wine on our French balcony on the other side of the apartment, watching many boats come by on the canal. 
Last summer we discovered the Amsterdam canals with our own private boat. Being near the water or on the water is one of the most relaxing things you can do in this city (there’s a boat rental nearby if you would like to try).  We also enjoy cooking and dining at home or somewhere else in the city.

We are Stance and Titus. We are 40, married, have 2 young kids and we live & work in Amsterdam (the Netherlands). Travelling is one of our passions and therefore we've opened this account. 

We are very much into visiting all the great places in the world and we prefer doing this in a personal, local way instead of from a general, all look alike, hotel chain. Maybe we meet up if we are staying in your apartment!

When we are travelling we also like to offer other nice people the opportunity to stay in our luxurious apartment in the city centre of Amsterdam. Please check out our advertisement to see if our apartment is the one you are looking for!

I work as a graphic/digital designer and recently started doing pottery. I love art, visiting musea, theater, opera & jazz concerts. In summertime and weekends you can find me in my tiny house in one of the lakes nearby for swimming, sailing, making BBQ's and relaxing. I love good food, walking or cycling in the city and the villages around. The nature surrounding Amsterdam is as special to me as the city itself.

I love to meet people and share stories. And if you want to, i am more than happy to tip and share the places I like best.
