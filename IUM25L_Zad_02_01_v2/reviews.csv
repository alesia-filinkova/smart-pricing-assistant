About the area is only information that it’s central located, but it’s totally unsafe and dangerous especially for female travelers, it’s not cool and dishonest that even never mentioned before! Use the taxis when you want to go outside is not a solution. About cleaning, the coffee machine is never washed before and generally average. I do not recommend this place.",0

I've been in Athens 4 times, and I've always stayed in Kolonaki, and this apartment is right next to the center of the area, yet it's in a quiet part of it. The apartment itself is spacious enough, clean and has all the things you might need. I also appreciate Elena's communication: the dryer was broken, so she got a new one in just a few days. Thank you for a great stay!",5

306234,91795684,2016-08-06,5375647,"As senior citizens arriving from New York, we were a little apprehensive about what to expect. However from start to finish we had a splendid experience. The taxi was arranged by Aris with cheerful Thomas the driver, and as we arrived at the building we were received graciously by Ilaria who took us upstairs and showed us around the apartment. In the evening we were delighted to meet Panos, who works with Aris, who dropped by to chat and ask us to let him or Aris know if there was anything we needed. This gave us a tremendous sense of confidence that our host will be there in case we needed any help.  The apartment was smart and elegant and had large glass windows allowing us to have a magnificent view of the Acropolis and Parthenon at night. It is located at a walking distance to all the famous sights of Athens, we even went shopping to the central market.<br/>Communication with Arris was excellent. <br/>We strongly recommend stay at this apartment. <br/>Srini and Nalini",5

Directions and ease of access to airport via train was excellent.  There is a small grocer across the street and the kitchen is fully equipped.  The apartment was tidy and clean upon arrival.  Ralou was kind and kept in contact throughout the stay.  The only thing that could have been improved was the shower.  It had a very slow drain and even with a short shower we were standing in 1-2 inches of water.  We did figure out the second to last night that if you don't turn the water all the way on in relieved the problem.  I did let Ralou know and she offered to have a plumber come out but we really didn't want someone in during our stay.  I am sure she will have it addressed before the next customer.

484925,535291573,2019-09-24,36168330,Holy Moly you must stay here for countless reasons.<br/>1) If there was such a classification as Super Duper Host then she’d be on it. We followed her advice on 3 food recommendations. All were excellent. In fact we gave the name of one of the restaurants to our Athenian friends to try out. There was a nation wide public employee strike on our day of departure. It included transit workers. The streets were jammed. Taxis hard to find. She arranged to have a taxi pick us up on time and get us from the Acropolis to the airport in one hour.<br/>2) The house is located at the foot of the Acropolis literally. The last road before the rock starts. The neighborhood was created for the stone masons who rebuilt the Parthenon. It’s been in the family since 1932. The unit itself is nice with two air conditioning systems. Everything works well. Good shower. <br/>3) Finally the roof. For this reason <br/>Alone I would come back.  You have a 180 degree panoramic view of the City.,5

1499953,66363507,2016-03-22,43913451,"Property is good BUT Host and her relatives are a NIGHTMARE to deal with. The Internet was left unpaid on 3 different occasions, the boiler broke down and it took them 2 weeks to replace and I was left with no hot water, the place was not professionally cleaned and the owners sister came and went as she pleased, constantly disturbing my stay. <br/>I rented the property for 4 months, i spent over EUR 10,000 and in the end I was accused of stealing a room aroma diffuser and a plastic coffee shaker both worth 7 euros.. Upon replacing them, despite the fact that I had not taken them I was accused of stealing towels. Luckily I had receipts of all the sheets, pillows and towels I bought the day I arrived in Athens and was able to win the case with nocarz. I will be carrying this matter further however and will be suing for defamation. On the basis of the character and lack of manners that this family has (owner and her despicable sister Marinela), I would advise you to spend your money elsewhere. There are some lovely places around the area that are owned by people that are not homophobic like the owners of this flat. AVOID at all cost! Not worth the risk..",0

The apartment has a full kitchen which was a big bonus compared to staying at a hotel, and has a gorgeous view of the Acropolis from the living and dining room areas. The bathroom is also big; with a spacious shower that never ran out of hot water or water pressure (you learn that these things can be a rare find in Greece).

What happened was that I arrived very late and tired from a very long flight, I followed the instructions for self-check-in but the key wasn't there. The host didn't respond to my texts and calls,  it was late too, I guess fair enough, however she should have made sure that the key was there. I couldn't find a hotel and it was very stressful. She responded the next day, apologized and refunded me. Mistakes happen, I hope she'll be more responsive and professional with her next booking.",4

We even walked to many of the sights. Great neighborhood with lots to do but located on a quiet street. Two bedrooms with doors and fold out couch in the office were all comfortable and clean. its a little complicated to get in, but the instructions were very useful so follow them carefully and bring a flashlight if you check in at night.

Anything we needed, she was there. Dora gave us great recommendations for both tourist attractions and local secrets, she helped us make the most of our days in the city, so we left having done everything we wanted and more.  She is the sweetest person you will ever meet with a heart that truly wants to make your experience the best it could possibly be. We left feeling spoilt and rejuvenated while having gained a friend, and what felt like a wise mentor to cherish through life.

The location can't be beat, and the flat is roomy and quiet, just what the four of us needed after long days soaking up all Athens has to offer.

He is a very caring person who told and showed us all around and gave us tips that helped saving money as well.<br/>The place is in a central region so you can choose how you go to places: take a bus right across the street, walk (20 minutes to the historical center) or if you're really really lazy a cab won't break the bank :). It's very safe around too! Exarchia square is 5 minutes away and has a great and cheap souvlaki.<br/>This was my first nocarz experience but I'm pretty sure it will be hard to beat. Kudos to Doros for that.",5

He was kind to be searching for me at the neighborhood at our agreed arrival timing.<br/><br/>Apartment was very good considering the price. It was large, spacious and with all necessary amenities to make it complete. The living room was also filled with all the guidebooks which the guests are allowed to use. There was also a small balcony for use. Location was at a quiet place with 10 mins walk to the nearest metro station. The only issue was that there's a need to turn on the water heater for 10-15 mins before going for the shower. <br/><br/>Doros was a very kind host who took time to explain his best to his guests. He also followed me to the mobile shop to get the data SIM card after arrival at his apartment.

He also kindly took the time to go over the map with us and make personal recommendations for things to see and do and places to eat.<br/>The apartment was spotless and looked exactly like the photos and we were amazed by the HUGE terrace with a view. The kitchen had everything  we needed and all the supplies I expected to find, from toilet paper to extra blankets, were on hand for us. The location was excellent, just a short stroll from the metro station in a neighbourhood that felt very safe, even late at night. There was a beautiful street market with all the produce you could imagine on Saturday morning and several restaurants recommended all within a 10 minute walk. The supermarket was just around the corner.<br/>We really enjoyed Athens and there was just too much to do in the five days we were there, so I'm sure we'll be back.

Although the inside is not the biggest, this did not matter to us as it’s located a couple of minutes walk away from a metro station which takes you to anywhere you need to go in Athens, so we didn’t spend lots of time inside the apartment! The areas seems very safe and there are some nice bars and restaurants close to the metro station too which is handy if you don’t want to go into the city centre. Theodore was a great host and check-in was very straight forward. His book of recommendations was incredibly helpful and gave us lots of ideas of where to go!

Orestis gave me such nice tipps about where to go to in Athens, and even some details about greak mythology and history or about culinary specialties like Rakomelo - really an extraordinary likeable host! I enjoyed my stay in Athens and in this accommodation fully - thumbs up!!",5

(Port transfers early in the morning) <br/><br/>We stayed for 3 nights in Athens and the room worked out very well! It's a small space but we were out exploring all day. Plus the beauty and spaciousness of the patio was breathtaking. This is a very private space with a few offices located on the lower floors and Marika’s owns a few spaces in the upper portion of the building. Very clean and the bathroom seems very new and we enjoyed taking showers after our long days in Athens. <br/><br/>Our first two days were spent visiting them major sites and on the third day we took a day trip to Hydra (strongly recommended if you are heading to the Cyclades islands and want to see a small piece of the Saronic islands).  <br/><br/>Enjoy the beauty of the Acropolis at sunset if you have a chance, the sun setting on the ruins is fantastic and I will surely never forget.

We appreciated that the host  offered suggestions for sights and eateries to visit in the neighborhood. This apartment might be problematic for a light sleeper; the pedestrian traffic outside mostly dies down by 9 or 10 p.m., but occasionally a noisy lout will make himself heard later in the evening.

The rooms were both a comfortable size and the beds provided a great night's sleep. the neighborhood is really quiet, which was just what we needed after a long day of travelling. The hot water was a little tricky, so be sure to ask for specific instructions on that. Other than that, everything was great and I would highly recommend Thaleia's apartment for your Athens visit.

Panos definitely deserves his 5 stars for communication, he responds quickly & thoroughly, walked us through the apartment, gave us tons of information on Athens...he's an incredibly nice guy. His mother lives around the corner so if you have an urgent need she can help immediately. Because we were there for a month we had the chance to chat with her, now we know why he's such a nice guy.

The produce was some of the freshest and largest we've seen at very low prices. There is a Friday market in the opposite direction, we didn't shop at it so I don't know how large it is.

A private paradise behind a red metal door on an unassuming street 10 minute walking distance from the Acropolis.  Everything was pristine and the place is truly a one of a kind gem.  And the area was super- probably 20 great restaurants within a 5 minute walk- we hard a tough time choosing which to visit !<br/>Lefteris was beyond helpful- he offered to show us around town, he left us an iPhone to use for local calls and maps, an iPod for the internet, he brought us a power adapter when we needed one, and he called and texted several times to make sure everything was exactly as we wanted.  You could not ask for a better host.   10 out of 10 and then some :))))))",5

The apartment felt so warm and welcoming - even better than the photographs led me to expect, and had everything we would need. It was extremely clean and comfortable, and the balconies in both the living room and the bedroom were especially delightful. Maria generously provided us with water, fruits, cereal, eggs and other healthy snacks, and made sure that the bathroom and kitchen had everything we needed. The apartment is in a quiet safe neighborhood near a metro station (Larissa Station), by which you can easily access all of Athens' hot spots. We had access to a pharmacy, a crepe house/cafe, a restaurant, a hair salon and a super market literally a few steps from the apartment building. We were also pleasantly surprised to experience a ""Laiki"" Farmers' Market set up  in the neighbourhood during our stay- I think it was either a Tuesday or a Wednesday. The only downside to the apartment was that it had no washing machine, but a laundry mat is located near the building, so that did not cause us much inconvenience. We truly had a good time and will treasure the memories of our time in Athens. I highly recommend Maria and her beautiful apartment!",5

The rooftop terrace is fantastic, and the perfect place to sit and enjoy breakfast or the sunset. I unfortunately also had to work during my stay, but the terrace is also a wonderful place for writing (if you have to work), and the internet connection was fantastic.

Only three blocks or so from the red line, which gets you to acropolis within 10min or so. Three stops, i believe. It’s quiet. Very much so. If you are solo, then maybe you might be little worried, but I would say the area is pretty safe. It’s generally clean. The floor is clean, the bathroom was clean for what it is, and the beds were clean. I wouldn’t sleep on the couch. But hey, it’s cheap. <br/>Con: it doesn’t have a lot.

We had lunch at the restaurant a few doors down while waiting to check in and the neighbourhood is busy but great for a relaxing meal while people watching. The apartment itself is small but was comfortable for the two of us. The futon is very hard so I wouldn't recommend a super long stay if you'll be needing both beds. Drosoula was so kind to have bread, cheese and orange juice waiting in the fridge for us and went over the map of Athens and suggested a walking route that we spent and afternoon following and loved.

Check in was super easy, and Aris very helpfully organized a taxi from the airport for us. He spent time showing us around the place, including the rooftop, and had a tabletop map and showed us the surrounding areas. His restaurant suggestions are spot on, too!

The second floor hosts a shoe workshop, that has huge machinery working from early morning to late evenings. Construction works in the area do not allow for an easy night of sleep.

Stelio est très sympa et réactif.<br/>Je recommande ++",4
12878761,261192844,2018-05-06,343982,"The place is very central and functional. The two main flaws are:<br/>1) It feels like nobody ever actually lived in it. It was redesigned and renovated to be an nocarz place, and it shows. There were important things missing in the kitchen, I found only one large pot and one small frying pan. As I was going to spend 10 days there, I bought some pieces of cookware, incl. a small pot to boil water (there is no kettle), plus paper towel, tin foil etc.. Also, no tea towels (I used a bath towel). In the shower there are no shelves for shampoo etc. I know these are small details, but it is what makes you feel at home in an nocarz place.<br/>2) The location, though unbeatable in terms of centrality, was also a big problem at night, as it is smack in the centre of the hub of night life in Athens. Starting after midnight, and going on even to 4 or 5 am in the weekends, I was woken up by people yelling, singing out loud, playing music, laughing, smashing bottles etc. Being on the third floor, you could hear all this as if it was right outside your window. Besides, even on nights that were not particularly hot, I had to use the a/c because I did not want to open the windows due to the noise.<br/>Stelios was very accurate and reliable. The place does not have a dishwasher, as I had read on the website, but it has a washing machine (although there are no tools for hanging your laundry). The ""dining table"" is very uncomfortable to sit at and not very stable. On the plus side, the bed was absolutely fantastic!",1

The neighborhood is very safe, and has a supermarket and bakery at a stone's throw away.<br/>Coming to the apartment itself, it's spacious enough for three people (perfect for two), with decent amenities in the bedroom and bathroom. The hall is very stylish and comfortable, and the entire place has a very homely atmosphere. <br/>The best part about this, however, is the host. Stefania was absolutely wonderful, making everything super convenient for us right from day 1. She is very helpful and caring, and ensures your stay is as enjoyable as possible.

Decent sized TV, decently equipped kitchen (only thing missing was a kitchen knife which the host assured us he would buy ASAP). Good value for your money.",5

These photos were not able to prepare us, however, for how beautiful her home truly is. Her shelves are full of books about art, ancient Greece, french plays, sociology, politics, etc etc, and her walls are covered in beautiful, framed art and prints. The attention to detail is really lovely, with plants and mood lighting across the apartment, and not to mention the fact that on top of being extremely clean, the flat smells wonderful (!!) with fun candles and essential oils placed around the space. The terrace is also full of lush plants — bumble bees would feed on the lavender and honey suckles in the morning as I had my coffee and the succulents were blooming. The apartment also has great working/office spaces as my partner worked during much of our stay and was able to stay very productive.  <br/>Elena was extremely responsive and supportive throughout our whole stay, not only as our host but also as what felt like a friend :) our only regret is that we did not have the chance to visit her jewelry shop on Antiparos, but we will have to do that next time!<br/>Staying at Elena’s apartment makes you feel like you lived a whole life in Athens and that you were able, over that time, to build a beautiful, eclectic, and comfortable home for yourself. Not to mention that the apartment is in a wonderful and calm neighborhood though a nice walking distance from most sites in the city, so it is perfect for the tourist experience as well. <br/>I couldn’t recommend this stay enough ✨🌊🌻💕",5

Also washing powder to be able to wash clothes.. another great asset. Little things like that make a massive difference to other nocarzs. <br/>It was close to restaurants, cheap places to eat, bakery etc. <br/>About a 10 minute walk to the metro station too! <br/>If there is only 1 negative thing, it would be that it is on the ground floor so when other residents enter the building, the door slams but it is the only minor thing.

There were 5 of us staying including my 15 month old daughter, who they supplied with a travel cot upon my request. Travel cots tend to have a very hard mattress meaning my husband and I loose our pillows to soften it but our hosts had thought of that and had ensured her cot was well padded a very thoughtful gesture and shows how far they are willing to go for their guests. Location of the loft is great with amazing views of the accropolis and beautiful church opposite. Very close to lots of restaurants, bars, shops and the ruins. The loft is clean,modern and felt like home with a private lift into the apartment which was great with our pram and luggage. Konstantinos and his lovely partner were there to greet us on arrival and had left supplies in the fridge another thoughtful gesture after a long trip. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to this amazing city. ",5

Linen, towels and kitchen were good but the ""industrial"" nature meant the apartment the floors and walls were tatty and dusty.<br/>On the downside...<br/>Very, very noisy.<br/>At night there is a bar opposite that stays open until the early hours and is very loud with drunken people shouting and singing continually.<br/>In the early morning, building work starts from 6.30am with concrete drilling and glass smashing as properties nearby are demolished / rebuilt.<br/>There is no sound insulation at all so you can hear people outside and when they come into the building three floors below.<br/>The shutters do no close properly and as there are no curtain the front bedroom is light all night. In the rear bedroom the shutters close but they do not block out any light.<br/>""Industrial"" is an understatement. There were wires sticking out of the wall covered in insulating tape and pipework cut off sticking out of the floor.<br/>The bathroom (it is a shower room really) is tiny. Really tiny. The sink is a small hand-rinse basin and shower small with no screen or curtain - be prepared for everything to get wet.<br/>No drawers or wardrobes - just bookshelf and clothes rail in the hall area.<br/>Very basic for the price. If it is impossible to sleep because of the noise then it is too expensive at any price.<br/>Psiri is described as ""up-and-coming"" but certainly has not arrived yet! It is dirty, smelly and noisy with lots of derelict buildings and graffiti. That said, it is an easy walk to most of the sights.<br/>The balcony was nice - it does have a good view and is bright and sunny in the morning - just so long as the wind doesn't waft the smell of drains / garbage over you.",5

It is a wonderful place to stay and a safe walking distance to most of the great sites of Athens, which includes the Acropolis and Plaka.  It is well decorated and had everything we needed for our week long stay.  We spent one of our days just enjoying the villa and all of its accommodations on Christmas Day.  We were able to prepare our Christmas meal while lounging around in our pajamas all day, and then later enjoyed time in the swimming pool, which was like being in a warm bath with available jacuzzi-like jets on one end. Each room was equipped with heat/air condition units; therefore, everyone could set a temperature according to their comfort.  The neighborhood was nice with several restaurants and a very nice bakery  nearby.  Coming for the U.S., the only suggestion we have is to make sure you get instructions on the microwave, stove and dishwasher from the host when you arrive.  They are totally different from what we were accustomed; however, once we figured them out, they worked great.  We would also suggest using the offered transportation service if you are coming in from the airport; especially, if you have a large group with a lot of luggage.  It is an eight passenger van with plenty of room for luggage.  It is very nice and clean, reasonably priced and the driver is very punctual and professional.

15521521,190431661,2017-09-04,3326494,"Wow, where to begin with Dimitris review. First of all what helped me choose this apartment above others was when I read Dimitris reviews. Everyone had written such positive comments and said what a great host Dimitris was and how friendly and welcoming he is and they were not wrong. Dimitris picked me up from the airport as I had a very early flight and I landed early morning. I got a chance to take a tour around the Acropolis area before being picked up again and taken to the flat. The flat itself was very clean but i'd say the best bit about it is the fact you can sit outside in a massive area with a brilliant view and a chance to enjoy your meals or drinks outside.  There's also a ladder outside that goes to the very top roof and you can sit up there for an even better view. It was amazing. The other good thing is the location of the flat.  My gf and I were walking into the centre of Athens every day. No need for a taxi really. Also there's a supermarket and cool bar close by. We also found some cool restaurants nearby too. Dimitris is a very friendly host and checked in with us by message just to make sure we had everything we needed. I couldn't rate him enough and i got the feeling he was a very genuine person and just wanted to make sure we had everything or if we had any questions. If so he's a message away. Definatley worth a stay and if i'm back i'd stay here again. Many thanks, Gavin.",5

The area is great. Very close to Exarcheia and well connected. Omonia Square with its  two metro lines is only five blocks away. <br/>If I came back to Athens I'd stay there again. ",5
15521521,306818255,2018-08-13,21837894,"We had a great stay at Dimitris’ place.  Very clean, stylish and well-equipped apartment. Amazing terrace with panoramic view and comfortable patio furniture. Dimitris was a very attentive host, and answered messages almost immediately whenever we had questions. The apartment feels safe with quality security doors, and the building itself is locked at night. The neighborhood is calm, although there is some traffic noise when on the terrace from a larger street about 100 meters away. For close dining, there is only a 6 to 8 minute walk to some great cafes and restaurants in the heart of the Koukaki area - great for travelers who like to go where the Greeks go - not packed full of tourists!<br/>Using the metro is not so convenient, as you have to either walk 13-15 minutes or take a bus to get to the station. However, a taxi to Syntagma (for example) from the apartment is only 3.50€, so 2 or more people together might actually Save money taking the taxi, and a short walk to a busier street is all you need to hail one as it drives by. <br/>An excellent place to stay, central yet away from the tourism. Great value for the money. Highly recommended!<br/>",5

The Netflix is connected to an account which is an added bonus! The front door is a little tricky to figure out as well as the door to the rental. It wasn’t till the last day there that we kinda finally figured it out. I guess this is pretty common in Greece because we dealt with the same thing with some of our other rentals that we stayed at.

15827156,693251684413141034,2022-08-14,27589045,"Unfortunately, our anticipated dream stay at George's managed place had turned into a sweaty and sleepless nightmare. Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly of our experience. The good: the view is truly incredible and the location made it easy to go downstairs into one of Athen's most lively restaurant and bar areas. The Bad: The place is simply not as nice as in the photos, everything felt worn and cheap and there were large stains on the couch. The bed mattress was cheap and uncomfortable. And the communication from the host was confusing. nocarz warns you that there may be an additional security deposit at booking, and after messaging the host about it, George reiterated that there will be a security deposit that we must pay, but it's unclear how or when that was supposed to happen. We wanted to self-check-in because our arrival time was uncertain (we were on a road trip with stops on the way) which George said was fine before we booked because there was self-check-in available, but then we got an automated message from him that insisted asking us for an exact check-in time and meeting some assistant (presumably to collect the security deposit? We never found out because he never responded to messages on check-in day). He later clarified that this was an automated message which out of date, but that just caused additional stress on us that we did not need to deal with on our holiday. This should have been simple and easy, and it wasn't due to a lack of attention to basic details like being consistent with check-in instructions. But here is when things get worse. George was quick to communicate before we booked but simply did not respond to our messages for help on the check-in day. When we arrived, the AC started to work for a minute but then it suddenly stopped, nothing would light up, and the temperatures are extremely hot in Athens in August so not having an AC is a problem, it means you can't really enjoy the space you just rented. I was sweating in the evening indoors even though the windows were open. We also noticed a very large stain on the couch (it looked nasty) and it just felt like the place is definitely not as clean as it looks in the photos. It looks like it's been heavily used and everything felt worn and stained all over. The UGLY: Since the AC did not work, and George was not responding at all, we had to keep the windows open to try to get fresh air in, but due to its location the street music from all the nearby bars (many bars with large subwoofers blasting music), street noise, and city noises, all mixed into a sound equivalent of vomit and all of that noise made its way up into the studio which made it impossible for us to sleep even with earplugs. Laying in that bed, sweating from the heat, with earplugs, and feeling like we were still in the middle of multiple dance floors felt extremely uncomfortable. We read that this might be an issue here in prior reviews, but I think if the AC worked and all the windows were closed, there is a chance to pass out eventually. But with the windows open to get fresh air, we could not sleep no matter how hard we tried to block the ears. Closer to the morning as the temperatures eventually cooled slightly, we closed all the doors and windows to try and get at least some hours of sleep and discovered that the AC suddenly turned on! How? It turns out there was a sensor at the windows/balcony door that turned off the AC and George failed to include that basic instruction in any of his documents, there are no signs, nothing. And since he didn't respond to our messages, we had no way of knowing this small but very important detail. The next day we had a flight, so not getting a good rest resulted in an uncomfortable day of trying to stay awake while dealing with car rentals and airport travel mess. Afterward, George messaged saying that ""I was out of the office"". He has 112 listings to deal with so don't expect him to respond to your particular booking if you have an issue. He offered a refund of 50 euros in exchange for a 5-star review but I think I owe it to fellow travelers to leave my honest experience here. I still gave this place 2 stars because of the incredible views, but I would not stay there again and would not recommend others stay here either. Perhaps if the host takes good care in cleaning and replacing worn/stained furniture, clarifies the communication to be 100% precise with instructions for check-in and security deposit instructions, and puts a simple sign about the AC sensors and includes it in the instructions, this place could actually one day be worth the money due to the view, but right now it's not.",0

Extremely roomy compared to most places in Europe.<br/>The view from the sofa and the giant outdoor patio is unreal!<br/>There is an elevator, which means you don't have to tote your luggage up and down flights of stairs.<br/>That said, the elevator is right next to the unit and very loud when it goes at all hours of the night. There is a nightclub just down the street that can easily be heard inside. It goes until 2-4am depending on the day. If you want somewhere to sleep early, this would not be a great place to stay. But if you want to be SUPER walkable and close to everything, it would be a great place!<br/>There was construction when I stayed, so I rarely slept as the club/bar noise went until 3-4am and construction started in the morning by 8am. I'm sure the construction is just temporary. <br/>The bed is extremely firm, so if you need a softer mattress, I would look elsewhere.<br/>Overall I would love to stay here again as it was just a fantastic location!",5

Kleio also arranged our pickup from the airport and we were very pleased to find out we could have access straight away. Kleio then gave us a rundown on places to go in Athens particularly where to eat and drink. As she is a former chef and now consultant to restaurants, her advice was impeccable. We dined at several of her suggested options and they were all beyond expectation.<br/>The apartment itself is located in a fantastic and more local position in a safe, gentrified and funky neighborhood just 10 mins walk from the Acropolis and has easy walking access to all inner Athens attractions. Everything including great eating, supermarkets, Plaka district is within walking distance. The images on nocarz whilst completely accurate probably cannot do it justice as the volume provided by the extra high ceilings makes for a very spacious feel. <br/>Kleio provides an unbelievably generous array of food, wine, beers, waters, coffee and other snacks (and even Berocca) the like we have never experienced before in a nocarz property. <br/>To wrap it up if you are staying in the fascinating and ancient city of Athens, and you want an authentic and supremely comfortable experience rather than a "" you could be anywhere hotel stay"" look no further.

This property and host deserve the very highest rating and I have already recommended her to others. Thank you Kleio!!",5

The issues we encountered were with the very loud road noise and night and the noise from the school during the day (which might not be a problem if you are out all day). <br/>The hosts really can't do anything about that so we understand it's unavoidable if you stay.  The beds, however, are extremely uncomfortable.  I stayed in the room with the double bed and my friend in the room with the 2 single beds.  We both had very uncomfortable nights.  The mattress are either very old or very cheaply made because we could both feel every single spring that we laid on. It was so bad I slept on the couch both nights.  Additionally, while the house was clean no one had bothered to sleep under the beds in a long while.  There were huge dust balls underneath which I found while checking the beds.  We both have allergies.  <br/>Overall, the hosts were good so I would recommend if the mattresses were replaced and you aren't too sensitive to street noise.

Toni has a cloth drying rack, so you will have to use that or go to one of the two coin laundromats two blocks away. There is also a market two blocks away (Go Market?

Comfortable bed. Toni was very responsive to my questions over the nocarz email and responded in a timely way. There were a few little downsides - the apartments sits over an outdoor bar, so there was music playing up until around 11 pm. Also, the phone number given in the instructions was to a company that dealt with many rentals, so the person I texted with was not Toni. But email communication was with Toni. That got a bit confusing. Finally, the kitchen was very nice, but there were no amenities. No paper towels/napkins, and no coffee pods to go with the coffeepot. Toni was extremely responsive to this last issue and send a friend over with some instant coffee since I was only staying for one night and needed to get to the airport early. Thank you!

We went back home around 9:30 pm during Saturday night and still seeing some people walking around in the neighborhood, it’s a quiet area but ok.

We enjoyed cooking in the very new kitchen, and can report that the oven is very fast & efficient. It was great to also catch up on some laundry. The neighbourhood, Exarcheia, is considered dangerous by some uber drivers, but we felt safe walking around and uncovering hidden gems, like the deli on the cnr of Emmanouil Benaki & Gravias Sts, nearby. Also excellent are the restaurant recommended by Ifigeneia, Ama Laxei; the Pnyka bakery on Totsita and the Saturday farmers’ market on Kallidromiou.

We weren't shown round the flat or told how things worked. We weren't given tips for places to eat or drink in the area. That said the host did answer texts very quickly and would provide any information you needed this way.<br/>Overall the apartment was very cheap and clean, but I'd rather pay more money for a place where I stand a chance of a good nights sleep.",5

We only wish we could have spent more time hanging out at the loft, but we were too busy enjoying Athens. For convenience, the location could almost not be improved - almost everything that a tourist might want is within walking distance, while the metro station, with direct trains to the airport and the port at Piraeus, is only 50 metres away. We appreciated the thoughtful touches, like the coffee, bread and jam, and the Korres toiletries. The only (small) downside of the central location was some noise at night - if you are a light sleeper and your visit is at the weekend, you might want to pack some earplugs.

The entire family made me feel welcome and at home, total privacy and yet right there if I needed anything, and everything you need is outside the door - food, markets, shops, shopping, laundry, barber shops, cheese shops, wine, on and on (even PCR tests if you’re traveling on. I needed one for Turkey, right up the street) and for me I walked everywhere - the Acropolis, Mount Lycabettus, the Acropolis Museum, the National Park, the Archaeological Museum (a bit of a walk but fine) and so much more. Walk the cemetery, and don’t forget to feed the cats!",5

It was clean and the bed was comfortable, and the amenities were great.<br/>The only feedback I would give is: even though the curtain blinds block out all light from outside (even in the daytime), I would recommend wearing an eye mask as there are various small intermittently flashing lights in the room where power sockets are which made sleep a bit difficult without an eye mask. Also, the staircase up to the flat is not lit at all, so watch your step or bring a torch. But I maintain this is still worth it otherwise!",5

His property is less than 75 yards from the subway, grocery store and a good number of restaurants. This was a huge blessing to us.

18445633,618543939426867094,2022-05-03,66986442,"5 Stars. This place was perfect for us (a couple) visiting Athens and Greece. The apartment is professionally hosted by a company named UPSTREET. They have close to 100 properties. So, though they try to provide personal service you may get a corporate response rather than a truly personal one. I know the difference since I have my own nocarz that I host in the U.S. I had a couple of concerns which were partially addressed. However, given that, I still give them/this place five stars. It's not the Marriott but it is within walking distance of so much. It's in a great location in Plaka with shops and restaurants very close by. The place was very clean and excellent, mostly well furnished. I learned for the first time (crazy me) that there are 2-in-1 clothes washers/dryers and they work. Internet service was great. Netflix worked well. The bed was comfortable. The place was safe. It was easy to access with this one caveat — they indicate it's on the first floor. However, you actually have to climb stairs to what we would consider the 2nd floor to get to the apartment so if that's a problem for you perhaps choose another of their properties that's actually on a first floor. We took an overnighter (by plane) with our backpacks to Santorini. We returned the following evening from the airport via the underground/metro and walked to the apartment. Our trip inside Greece totaled six days and we're very happy we chose this particular nocarz on Thalou Street!",5

I have been in hundreds of nocarz-s in Greece and different countries, but this was the best experience so far. The house is in a very nice area with several public transportation, but there are also supermarkets, pharmacies, and a lot of more useful shops around by just a few mins on foot. The flat is on the 5th floor so it's really silent, we were never bothered by any noise. The two terraces are really really great, our little cat has enjoyed the stay also, as she was able to look around. The apartment is really really modern, and it is comfortable! All the furniture are new,  the doors and windows close fine, there are blinders also in the flat. The air conditioners also work really well, they heated up the room in just a few minutes. The TVs were a big experience, Maria and her husband were so nice they have bought another TV in the bedroom for our request. I was amazed. The bedding, the towels, and everything was sparkling clean and brand new, so as the iron, drier, hair drier... There were a lot lot more than even necessary which again, made the stay very comfortable. We had cleaning stuff, masks, gloves, snacks, coffee, really everything you can even think about. I am two left handed and made some tiny accidents, and when I let Maria know she was really really nice and helpful with the cases. She was so understanding, and so is her husband. They are the loveliest hosts I have ever met. Getting and leaving the keys was really fast and easy, even once we left the keys Maria's husband came in a couple of minutes to help us out.

Larissa is an edgy area and lacks services on foot, but it's very well connected to the metro. The view is excellent and the best part about this apartment is its large and clean rooftop (with automatic shade awnings ...you need them!). <br/> The interior is charming and kept cool by the new looking air conditioner. We appreciated having a washing machine. The bed is comfortable and there are TV subscription services like Netflix. The biggest thing to note is the ever-present wet cave mildew smell that might annoy guests. We suspect it's from the building plumbing, and therefore difficult to ameliorate, but if you're sensitive to smells, then take note. If you're okay with that (and it's fine if you open the windows), then you'll enjoy your time here - the price is excellent!",5

My brother and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Despite the areas of Omonia and Exarcheia in which the property is situated being listed as ""places to avoid in Athens"" on Google, we actually both felt relatively safe. We would both probably advise just walking home with someone at night and sticking to well-lit streets. In the day we felt very comfortable in Athens. The apartment is a lot smaller than the photos make it out to be, and also far less modern. However we still found it charming, cosy and the perfect base for our 4 day exploration of the wonderful city. Communication from the host was 5 stars and the check-in was seamless.

However, if youve had the opportunity to venture around Athens prior to checking in, you will find graffiti on just about any and everything.  Please dont let this fool you.  The condo is beautiful.  Its modern, updated clean, and a break away from the hustle and bustle of the City of Athens.  Theres even a couple of small little restaurants/pubs next door, which we didnt initially notice.  However, the windows must be sound proof because we didnt hear anything.  Long story short, if we  were to travel to Athens again, we would definitely stay here again and we highly recommend to everyone.  Thanks Toni!",5

We had a small issue with the lock downstairs (which I believe has been fixed since) and called the host at 2am. She not only picked up the phone but was ready to come help. She was also available at 5am when our car service to the airport was late (once again, generously arranged by the host and not her fault that it was late).

First, I am very grateful that we could stay at the other flat and my booking wasn't just cancelled! The flat was clean and tidy, the neighbourhood is nice. The kitchen is directly in front of your bed, so you can hear the fridge at night. Also, the building is poorly soundproofed, you can hear the neighbours leaving and talking. At the moment, there is construction work going on, on the building next to the backyard, that woke us at 7 a.m.  So, nothing for light sleepers. You don't get sunlight at all, and the sunblind above the backyard couldn't be moved, we tried! But at least the flat was cool! I was contemplating about giving 3 stars because after 2 days the flat was so humid that even our clothings in the wardrobe were cold and damp, even though we opened the yard door, and we kept the ventilation in the bathroom going until we left for the day.",5

The metro stop is where the eastern area of the Platka begins. The venue is a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis and 5-10 minute walk to Hadrian’s Library (next to the Agoras). On the road to the Acropolis are street vendors that sell shirts, dresses, masks, toys, olive oils products, etc. <br/>The owner communicated to us via direct message a day after the booked and included contact info, how to take the metro from the airport to the stop, addresses, and local things to do. <br/>The venue is a normal European style dwelling. It is quaint with a nice bed, little sit down area with a couch, good kitchen and good bathroom. Has an iron and ironing board, ability to cook on stove, and magazines of things to do. It is well styled but no view outside. Walls are kind of thin but didn’t keep me up at night. <br/>It is on the 2nd floor with access to an elevator (I wouldn’t use though it is old school looking). <br/>Would stay again.",3

The elevator made everything much more accessible than we are used to in Europe, and we loved being able to keep our toddler in her stroller to make the trip up to the top floor. The apartment itself was super cute and well-kept, and incredibly clean -- exactly as pictured. We were accommodated with a baby bed for our toddler, and it was very safe and comfortable. The apartment itself was very spacious, and we enjoyed having all of that space to unwind. I had read ahead of time that the bells from the church bother some of the guests, but to be quite frank, we didn't even notice. We loved being close to the shopping, having the main sights accessible to us, and having a lot of great restaurants nearby. We felt safe when we were outside, as well as inside. Of course, the star of the apartment was the view. It was every bit as lovely as you imagine from the pictures. Because we have a toddler and we knew that we would be tethered to our apartment in the evenings after she went to bed, gorgeous views were important to us, and this one certainly did not disappoint.

There is an A/C unit in the main living space and both bedrooms. Furthermore, there is a full bath and a powder room. We felt so comfortable staying at this apartment.

The lift was fantastic as the apartment is on the fourth floor. <br/>Lina provided plentiful information and advice about how to operate everything in the flat, where to eat, shop and visit and she organised airport taxis as well. Nothing was too much bother and she always responded immediately to any questions I had. For example she recommended a cruise to three of the Saronic Islands which was wonderful.

Get your steps in and then enjoy the fabulous Greek food available at every turn. The view of the Acropolis from the perfect sized marble tiled balcony  is thrilling, day or night.

The apartment is spacious for two and is nicely furnished. It also has a dish washer which was very helpful. The bed is conformable. The kitchen is equipment with pots/pans and lots of dishes. the managing company was pretty quick in responding. <br/>The cons:<br/>The noise! the apartment is located right in front of a very busy street and also back again another street. So started at around 6 am you hear nothing but cars. You can't even open the windows if you need to work. The apartment gets dusty pretty quick as well. The apartment is lack of some necessities for a longer stay: For a week's stay, we were initially offered only one towel each with a tiny bottle of bodywash about the size of my thumb.

So you sense that she takes it seriously and puts effort.<br/>Her flat is just 2 minutes away from the Megaro Mousikis station which is 2 stops away from the Syntagma station, one of the main stations in Athens, so location is great.

Also, the walls are quite thin (just like in every building in Athens), so be prepared to hear your neighbors or passer-bys during the night. The street and area is very green and nice. There's cafés, a bakery, a shop for fruits and vegetables and some restaurants just around the corner. Also, it's really nice to hang out at Varnava Square closeby.

Location is excellent - walking distance to major attractions, shopping areas, as well as near non-touristy neighborhoods that are a pleasure to stroll through.  The area and building are quiet, beds are comfortable, shower is amazing, and ACs work beautifully. A vacation, I have learned (the hard way) is only as good as your accommodations. Staying in Artistos' place I am sure made my time in Athens as amazing as it was. It was genuinely a pleasure to come back to it every day and wake up there, I felt right at home. ",5

Στην πραγματικότητα τα πράγματα ήταν ακόμα καλύτερα... Το σπίτι είναι ακριβώς όπως στις φωτογραφίες, καθαρό, μοντέρνο, άνετο, ήσυχο με όλες τις παροχές που χρειάζεται κάποιος, καλή και ήσυχη γειτονιά μόλις 15 λεπτά από την πλάκα με τα πόδια. Το σπίτι μπορεί άνετα να φιλοξενήσει 4-6 άτομα. Μια μικρή λεπτομέρεια που κάνει την διαφορά είναι ότι δεν έχει μόνο εξοπλισμένη κουζίνα (που έχουν πολλά σπίτι) έχει και τα απαραίτητα για να ετοιμάσεις ένα καλό πρωινό, να κάνεις το καφέ σου κτλ. Ο οικοδεσπότης ευγενικός και πρόθυμος να εξυπηρετήσει σε ότι χρειαστείτε Εμείς θα το επιλέξουμε ξανά!!!",2

É bem equipado no geral e fica ao lado de uma avenida principal (Patision), com mercados e restaurantes facilmente acessíveis. Mesmo estando perto de uma avenida de trânsito intenso, os espaços são silenciosos devido às esquadrias acústicas em todos os ambientes. Apesar de não ficar localizado em uma região próxima aos principais pontos de interesse em Atenas, encontra-se a 0,5 km da estação de metrô Victória. É uma distância relativamente curta e fácil para se locomover a pé, mas se estiver com malas grandes e pesadas, recomendo táxi.  O único problema mais destacado do apartamento é o chuveiro. Como é comum na Grécia, é necessário ligar o disjuntor previamente para a água esquentar, mas mesmo fazendo os procedimentos corretos, a duração da água quente é muito curta e mal dá para tomar um banho sem que comece a ficar gelada.

It was very clean and very safe, wonderful neighborhood that is not loud at all.  The apartment has everything you need, fully stocked kitchen if you want to cook (we ate out every meal).  Wine and bottled water on arrival, as well as toast and jam for the next morning.  Individual climate control for each bedroom and living area.  Washing machine was easy to use.  And it's close to everything!  We visited the Acropolis (south entrance near by) and Acropolis museum (right across the street), we walked to Sintagma square and the National Gardens.  We took the metro to the National Archaeological Museum,  just a few stops away.  We hiked up to Filopappou Hill- most beautiful views of Athens and the Acropolis.  We are dinner at the plaka (To Kafeneion  (address Epicharmou 1) has authentic Greek on a nice side street).  We also discovered To Kati Allo right outside the apartment- the most delicious Greek food I've ever had (we ate there twice!)  Wonderful mother and son duo who run the place with unbelievable hospitality and great prices.  It is very unassuming walking by,  you will not regret eating there!  Our only regret was not having more days in Athens.  We look forward to staying at Peripatos again!",5

25668633,528007395131800643,2021-12-29,241242206,"Let’s start with the obvious. The view. Wow, just wow! Few places in Athens will give you such a marvelous view of Parthenon and Acropolis, which is absolutely stunning day or night. That view alone is well worth the price of admission! You can enjoy it from a living room or a large terrace adjacent to it, weather permitting. But view is hardly the only perk. You get a centrally located, clean, spacious, nicely appointed apartment, with a well stocked kitchen, from utensils to coffee. There’s a cafe downstairs and a grocery shop a few steps away as well as literally dozens of restaurants within 10-15 minutes walk. The owner was attentive and helped eagerly with arranging our transfer from and to the airport, so our trip to Athens was smooth from beginning to end. Dimitros, the driver, was always on time and super efficient and informative. Our only gripe is the occasional noise coming from a busy street that runs along the Acropolis. But then, maybe it’s just us, used to absolute quiet of suburbia. We’d be delighted to come back!",5

My son fell asleep on the sofa bed each night staring at the Parthenon. It was a highlight of the trip for him. The location is right on the corner of an  intersection, so traffic in the evening can easily be heard on the street, but it wasn’t enough to keep anyone from sleeping. <br/>The local mini mart and bakery a couple of blocks away were fantastic! They were very welcoming and helpful with suggestions and translations. <br/>If we make it back to Athens, this will be the first place I look for next time. Great communication, helpful recommendations, and they even helped arranged a ride for us from the airport. It was so nice to leave baggage claim and see the driver holding a sign with our name. Such a seamless transition helped get our trip off to a fantastic start!",5

The only negatives for us was that the hairdryer didn’t work which was a minor inconvenience for my wife and we would have preferred to have been able to close the bedroom door that is permanently open for ‘health and safety reasons’. I’ve never experienced this in an Air BNB before but nonetheless it was a minor issue that was in no way detrimental. Overall, a handy, functional apartment made all the better by an exceptional host. Would highly recommend!",5

Σε μια από τις καλύτερες γειτονιές της Αθήνας.<br/>Είμαστε μια οικογένεια με ένα μικρό παιδί 2 ετών. Φεβρουάριος 2020<br/>Δυστυχώς δεν μείναμε ευχαριστημένοι λόγω των προβλημάτων που αντιμετωπίσαμε.<br/>Πρώτο το ζεστό νερό στο μπάνιο. Πλενόμασταν με σχεδον καυτό νερό, επειδή όταν γυρναγαμε το μοχλό στη ντουζιέρα για χλιαρό νερό, η πίεση του νερού έπεφτε πολύ σε σημείο να μην μπορούμε να πλυθούμε. Το παιδί το πλέναμε αναγκαστικά με ποτήρι από τον νεροχύτη.<br/>Η αποχέτευση του μπάνιου ήταν βουλωμένη και τα νερά λιμνάζουν.<br/>Ο εξαερισμός του μπάνιου υπερβολικά βρώμικος, σαν να μην έχει καθαριστεί ποτέ και είναι τοποθετημένος ακριβώς πάνω από την λεκάνη της τουαλέτας.<br/>Ο φούρνος στην κουζίνα ήταν βρώμικος μέσα, ακατάλληλος για μαγείρεμα.<br/>Υπάρχει εγκατάσταση κεντρικής θέρμανσης αλλά δεν ανάβει λόγω έλλειψης πετρελαίου. Ζεστασιά μόνο με aircondition και ένα αερόθερμο.<br/>Το πάτωμα ήταν καθαρό.<br/>Μείναμε δύο μέρες και το πρόβλημα του μπάνιου, και του φούρνου που δεν μπορούσαμε να μαγειρέψουμε μας ταλαιπώρησε, ειδικά το παιδί μας.",2

The view is amazing, location in terms of restaurant walking to acropolis, and night life were all great and Mary was very easy to get in contact with. Bathroom is tight so be prepared for that. It’s the sink then the shower then the toilet in a straight row. But apartment itself is very spacious with amazing balcony over looking the Acropolis. <br/>Two things to point out that I saw in which I didn’t bother the host about because we were there for only two nights is that the shower curtains had mildew on it which was prob just an over sight by the cleaning lady so wasn’t the biggest deal and the other thing was the front of the apartment. Athens is beautiful but you do see the graffiti all over the place and the building was half warehouse half apartment it seemed like to me. Elevator almost gave me a heart attack because it is very old school and tight so for one there is a door that closes but tight space and for the other u get on and there is no door until u get to ur floor you are just staring at the brick wall and for that purpose I opted to take the stairs when we were going out and coming back to the apartment. <br/>Overall I would say the apartment and the view is spectacular but building and street it is on is a little sketchy but one street over and Athens come alive. <br/>Now that I know what to expect I would stay again and pack a lot lighter so the steps won’t be a problem!",5

Buzzing with small cafes and friendly restaurants, a plethora of tiny retailers, from rugs to fabric, from kitchen and bathroom appliances to children's toys, spiritual bead shops and street markets. <br/>There's a minor snag to be aware of: especially if you're a light sleeper you'll likely be up from 7am when the church bells kick you out of bed.

The location is great, really central, though you can't drive right up to it (and if you had a car, parking would be basically impossible in this neighborhood), and it was quiet and clean.

Appartamento 4.1 è al 4^ piano con ascensore, ha una bella terrazza abbastanza grande per fare colazione o aperitivo. Cucina con tutto il necessario per cucinare piatti leggeri.

E' un po' rumoroso il week end perchè c'è una disco di fronte ma la camera è sul retro quindi silenziosa. La posizione è strategica si trova a pochi metri dalla via principale Ermou e da Piazza Syntagma e comunque a pochi minuti a piedi dall'Acropoli, Plaka e Monastiraki. L'unico problema riscontrato è che ogni tanto soprattutto la sera c'è un odore molto sgradevole nel bagno. Qualità/prezzo ottimo. Lo consiglio.",3

Volgens verhuurder kan dat voor de deur, maar straat van appartement is erg smal. Wij hebben,  vanwege ons buitenlands kenteken,  gekozen voor een betaalde parkeergarage waar toezicht is. Op de kosten van 10 Euro per dag hadden we niet gerekend  Uiteindelijk zijn die door verhuurder vereffend met de kosten voor een fout onzerzijds: voor de veiligheid had onze dochter de deur van het appartement dichtgetrokken, maar sleutels bleken aan binnenkant deur te zitten....<br/>Nestor en Chris zijn superhost. Persoonlijk vonden wij hun communicatie wat dwingend: veel do's en don'ts. In de praktijk moet je niet alleen hoofd- maar ook de kleine letters lezen.<br/>We misten een koffiezetapparaat.

The place was spacious, quiet, benefited from a lot of natural morning and afternoon sun (both on the terrace and in the sun-facing rooms), and was in one of the best central, but not touristy, parts of Athens. <br/>Working was facilitated by a very comfortable large table in the lounge as well as a working 'shelf' in the second bedroom. Wifi was available everywhere, although due to the size of the apartment, it was naturally strongest near the router in the lounge. <br/>Nearby the apartment there are plenty of transport options, plus a good selection of supermarkets and specialist food shops, and for when everything is open again, ample bars, restaurants and other amenities. The neighborhood of Koukaki is a superb, livable neighborhood where you can get a good sense of really living in Athens rather than just merely visiting. One of the nicest aspects of the neighborhood was its proximity to the acropolis and the hills surrounding the ruins, which served as an easily accessible break from work in the middle or at the end of the day. <br/>The agency managing the property answered queries very promptly and were very accommodating when I needed a flexible checkout. They also responded to and acted upon a request for an additional kitchen tool rapidly, making the experience seamless. <br/>Highly recommended, both during and, I am sure, after pandemics ;)",5

The neighbourhood itself isn't the nicest - not in terms of people just in terms of aesthetics - but there are a lot of restaurants to enjoy.<br/>The room itself is small, which is part of its charm, but it is a bit too small in some places. For example, the roof of the shower is a lot lower than the actual roof, because of this I had to crouch to shower. Please note that I am not that tall (1.78/5'10), so if you're taller than that you might want another room instead.<br/>The toilet is also placed rather awkward between the glass of the shower and an outcrop, which can be a bit of an experience when you have to throw the paper into the bin in front of you.<br/>I would definitely recommend this room if you're staying for a short while as it is so easy to get everywhere you need to. All its disadvantages aren't the end of the world, and can actually be quite enjoyable to deal with if you're not too attached to luxury.",5

The Internet connection was good and I was able to work online without issues. Manos kindly gave me two Wifi networks to connect to,  so it was good to have a backup if needed. <br/>The apartment has a ""lived in"" feel in the sense that the furniture and appliances aren't brand new. Instead of feeling like you are staying in a generic hotel room, you feel like you're staying in a real Athenian apartment. The building and surrounding area could be noisy at times (the usual sounds of neighbours sharing a building, plus a nearby barking dog), but Manos kindly provided earplugs. <br/>The neighbourhood is really nice. Lots of restaurants, cafes, bakeries and shops (larger and smaller supermarkets). It is less than 10 minutes walk to the metro, which connects you with Athens city centre, the port and the airport.",5

36332503,743944206670770866,2022-10-23,5762742,"This place is a great value for your money. It has two spacious bedrooms with comfy beds, a large sunny balcony to eat your breakfast and a small kitchen that gets the job done with a lot more appliances than on the photos (coffee maker, toaster, kettle and some others in the cupboard that we didn’t even use besides the microwave and the portable induction hob), making a breakfast or a small dinner is easy when we didn’t want to eat out. We really enjoyed having plenty of space and having an elevator to reach the 3rd floor was also a blessing after long days of walking around. The place was clean as well, although some furniture has started to show the wear and tear of guests coming and going every couple of days. Two metro stops (green and blue line) are within 10 minutes, we used those a lot, but pretty much any attraction can also be reach on foot. (On the downside green runs in front of the house and can be noisy before midnight and early in the morning.) The AB supermarket is also just minutes away across the tracks and it has a huge selection, but smaller markets are also available nearby even late at night. Would stay again.",5

It’s a nice residential neighborhood away from the hoards of tourists but still easy to walk to most places or take two different metro lines nearby. The flat is spacious, has a well functioning kitchen that we used a lot (there’s a large AB supermarket just across the tracks to get supplies if you don’t want to eat out every meal) and a nice sunny balcony to people watch while having your morning coffee. Overall we found it’s a great value for our money, and we would be happy to return any time.",5

Otherwise, we walked everywhere.<br/>The apartment was well stocked with essentials, and was perfect for two adults and two young children.

The apartment is nested on the top floor of the building and is fully renovated, clean and modern. You really feel like you are on your own private oasis when you’re on the terrace: it is huge with a 360 view of Athens (including the Acropolis) and beautiful decorated. Despite being there during the lockdown, I had a wonderful time sitting outside and enjoying the autumn sun. The indoor space was on the smaller side, which was plenty for me as I was traveling on my own, but I wouldn’t recommend it for more than 2 adults (unless someone doesn’t mind sleeping outside on the couch, which could actually be a viable option) or a family with small children.<br/>Having been in Athens on other occasions previous to the lockdown, I can confirm other reviews who mention that the location is excellent. You are very centrally located, very close to Athen’s main attractions, yet can enjoy some quiet time as the apartment is on a smaller street just off the centre. There are many restaurants and shops nearby, and you can easily walk to other districts if you want to explore Athens further.<br/>Vicky was a great host, she is friendly and personable, organized a pickup for me at the airport despite my late evening arrival and remained readily available throughout my stay.

The only thing we would comment on is the area it is located.

We were two girls, frightened no matter what time of day (not to mention the night..) to leave and enter the building. Yes, few streets down you have a nice square with restaurants and bars, however walk into the street around the corner and you will find yourself in a bad place. The amount of homeless, dependent on drugs and in many cases, mentally ill people left to themselves on the streets is horrifying! I am a writer and it really gave me a strong feeling of the crisis in Greece. Not sure if you want to experience that going on holiday though, to relax. We have been approached daily by man in a questionable state, with proper blood stains on clothes etc..twice I had to get inside of my car and lock the doors to escape. Still, the guy kept banging on my window and I had to drive away. I will spare other stories.. you can imagine it made our stay miserable and exposed to extra costs since we had to leave the car at some point in the city on the secured parking to be able to sleep at night. Also, didn't even stay at the place for 2 nights cause we were scared to go back late - after one night, another terrible experience... I don't like to give bad opinions, everyone wants to make a business. But I feel responsible to let anyone who's planning to stay here know, what they're signing up for.",0

I believe the full price is seriously overpriced for the size of the apartment and the amenities available. On top of that, what I really disliked was the lack of soundproofing and the shady main building entrance at night.<br/>I unfortunately will not be choosing this apartment again when visiting the area and I wouldn’t suggest it to people looking for a private stay and/or people looking for a place they feel 100% safe returning to late at night. <br/>Besides the above, the place was as seen in the pictures and very clean. Check-in and check-out were contactless, which I always like as there was flexibility on arrival times.

I had to close the door during the night just so the whole apartment one smell like cigarette.again this is not the host problem and hopefully you won’t have someone that smokes next to you while you stay.<br/>One less thing is, I had an issue with the Wi-Fi it kept dropping  I was not able to maintain full conversations over zoom.

We have already recommended it to our friends for their future trips. <br/>The pictures are true to what the villa offers. It's lovely and charming, and the location cannot be beat!Truly so close to the Acropolis; it's magical to look out from our windows at the walls and so convenient to walk up to the entrance early in the morning to beat the crowds. <br/>This rental is at the top of the Plaka neighborhood — convenient to many cafes and shops but above the crowds and bustle that congest the lower parts of the neighborhood. Every evening we retreated to the back patio and could hear music and performances from various parts of the city, but were above it all (and once we closed the doors, did not hear any outside noises when it was time for bed). <br/>The interior is nicely appointed and we appreciated the full kitchen and two bathrooms. If we had traveled with more people than just the two of us, the fold-out beds downstairs would have been very handy. As it was, we enjoyed the very comfortable master bedroom with plenty of light and a very comfortable bed and pillows. <br/>The best thing of all about this rental was the outdoor space. In searching for a place to stay in Athens I was hoping to find someplace with a terrace or balcony or patio — this has four!! There are two small balconies, one off the front and one off the back, with just enough room for two chairs and a small table on each, perfect for sipping your morning coffee. There is also the amazing front courtyard, which has ruins beneath the thick glass floor (tourists will frequently stop to look over the fence in amazement). But the best of all is the large back terrace off the bedroom, with its amazing view of the city, nice couches, jacuzzi tub and shower. This was our favorite place to enjoy the evenings. <br/>For Americans, you should bear in mind that this is Europe and everything may be a bit smaller than you're used to. If you don't mind ducking your head to get through the patio door and can appreciate the charm of making the most of a sometimes limited space (as is true everywhere in Europe), you will love this rental as much as we did!<br/>The host was incredibly responsive to our requests and inquiries, always responding quickly, and sending many recommendations in advance for things to do and see and places to eat. He provided great information on the various transportation options from the airport and even arranged a taxi for us in advance (more convenient and a little cheaper than it would have been for us to do ourselves). There was even a bit of coffee in the kitchen, a bottle of cold water in the fridge, and a gift of wine awaiting our arrival. It couldn't have been nicer!",5

The first and most dangerous was the washing machine that did not function from day one and electrocuted my partner when he tried to use it as did the electric oven in the kite hen. Secondly, the lamp next to the bed exploded as soon as it was plugged in, producing smoke. Combined with the washing machine/ over  it seems there is an electrical fault with the apartment making it unsafe, especially so when you realise there are no smoke alarms! <br/>The water in the bathroom toilet never stopped running meaning you have to turn it off at the mains as soon as you are finished.<br/> <br/>The balcony was covered in old pigeon poo with no effort to clean it up. To top it off, you are visited regularly by feral, starving cats begging for food and at night you will spend hours listening to a lonely dog howling in what seems like pain, a few doors down. <br/>Host asked for passport details I assume for tax reasons, however, there is no legal requirement for a passport holder to divulge their private information to essentially a stranger, for this the host has downgraded their review. <br/>We left the apartment 5 days early as it was just a horrible experience in the end, sadly. <br/>We stripped the bed/ sofa for easy cleaning and swept/ mopped through the apartment as an act of kindness before leaving but this was received negatively by the host, again sadly. <br/>I’d think carefully before booking this property, unfortunately it’s not up to standard.",0

Clean, comfortable, nice bathroom and right in the middle of the city where more locals are.<br/>Check in process was really cumbersome and is the reason I’m not giving this place 5 stars.<br/>When we arrived outside we opened the lockbox and there wasn’t a key! I then messaged and called the host a bunch of times till I finally got a response (10min). Thankfully some people that stayed in other apartments in the building were coming in so they let us in the building but it’s very confusing and maybe a video should be made walking you through the check in process and all the different doors you have to go into just to get into the apartment. <br/>Other than that the place was good. Just beware that check in could be a little more if a hassle than other places.<br/>Overall I would recommend this place.",5

They arranged airport pickup and drop off for us - we were a family of four with buggy and more bags than usual. They were also incredibly responsive even when asked a silly question like how to turn on the hob (I was being daft not working it out). The location is perfect for the main tourist sights in Athens. We walked everywhere. But the street you are on is pretty quiet. The apartment is also exactly as pictured. The only reason it was four stars for us is that with a young family we did more cooking at home than others might and while the kitchen has everything you need there isn't a lot of room for cooking. For most people - especially those who plan to eat out mostly (and there are a lot of fine restaurants around) it would probably be five stars.  For those who do plan to cook at home, there are a couple of larger supermarkets within five minutes walk of the apartment that are worth seeking out rather than the smaller closer ones.",5

Robot pulitore e Smart tab non utilizzabile.

42746904,661420277,2020-09-07,90800910,"Steve's place is just wonderful.<br/>First of all, it's Kolonaki. I've lived here for 40 days back in 2017, but I was much closer to Lycabettus. I wouldn't recommend that: even though living up high looks nice, it takes a lot of energy to get home, especially if you're with groceries. Steve's place is right next to the Kolonaki square. It's around 8-10 minutes walk to the Syntagma square (the center of Athens), there are 3 grocery stores very close: OK, Kretikos and Sklavenitis, and there are plenty of restaurants, shops, cafes, and bars just a few minutes away. Kolonaki is the safest area in Athens, it's probably one of the most expensive too, but there are many reasons to pay for it more. Once you live here for a bit, you won't choose any other area.<br/>How about the place itself? It's good. It's clean, it looks modern, the internet is quick enough even for me (I come from Lithuania, so you can trust me on the Internet speeds). It has a fridge, shower, cooking stove, coffee machine, washing machine, iron, hairdryer, TV, pretty much everything you might need even for a long stay.<br/>And it simply looks nice. Mostly black & white, minimalist style. The way I like it. All in all, it's a 10/10 apartment, and Steve's communication is exceptional too, you won't have any problems. If you're looking for the best experience for a moderate price, this is your best bet.",5

The apartment itself has recently been fully renovated so everything in it was brand new, modern, spacious and clean. I liked the whole decor, which I found to be both elegant and cozy. Since I’m not the easiest sleeper I was happy to see that the mattress was very comfortable and that there were blackout curtains in the bedrooms. Having been to Athens before I know that having hot water all day and still being able to take a hot shower in the evening is not always a given depending on where you stay. Thankfully, this was not the case here and I had more than enough hot water every day. The kitchen was fully stocked and the wine and cookies left by the hosts were a very nice touch! <br/>The outdoor space is huge! Larger than expected. Both bedrooms and living room have direct access to it by sliding door. The plunge pool was definitely a highlight, and the hosts made sure that it remained clean and warm throughout my stay. <br/>This was my first time staying in that area of Athens (aptly named the “Acropolis” area) and I’m glad I discovered it. The apartment is quite close to the Acropolis museum and Acropolis “walk” (a 5 mins walk tops) which is great in itself but also allows you to easily find your way to other neighbourhoods such as Plaka. The apartment is located downtown so it’s at a walking distance to all services such as shops, groceries restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, metro, etc.<br/>Yannis and Tax are amazing, professional hosts, they really went out of their way to make sure that I had everything I needed. They arranged a very nice transfer from the airport and were very adaptable when I had to delay my arrival. I enjoyed my stay so much that I decided to extend it.

It's right in the heart of the city within 5 minutes walking distance to the Acropolis Museum and within 15 minutes walking distance to the top of the Acropolis, plus close to a variety of other monuments, ruins, shops, great streets, tasty restaurants, etc. The locations is excellent! Their communication is superb. They do everything to ensure you have an excellent and smooth stay. They'll even arrange airport transfers for you, if you'd like. As for the place itself, it's wonderful. Such a great aesthetic, very clean, and with a gorgeous view of the Acropolis.

When we entered the room we where shocked to realize that there is no actual window facing outdoors like we would have guessed but rather a window facing a grey wall with no actual sunlight flowing inwards which had us feeling claustrophobic. The Appartement is on the 6th floor and if you really bend your back you can actually see the sky. If shiny in the description refers to the appartement being clean then its the right word. Other than that there is nothing shiny about it whatsoever.,2

I thought the location would not be an issue but the dual carriage way really had an impact - the noise could be heard all the time in the apartment and we hated crossing the road. Previous reviews stated the noise was not an issue but I dispute that. There was also major building work taking place at the hotel next door which meant it was noisy from 08 00 and the builders smoking created a terrible smell throughout the apartment, particularly in the bathroom. We were compensated but I would have preferred it if we had been informed ahead of making the booking. I am sure the hosts would have been told when the work was going to start by the hotel.<br/>We felt the apartment was not quite as homely as the photos suggested.

A deep bleaching of the shower and maybe mattress topper would help these tow issues.

46977855,717076656,2020-12-21,18349174,"I had the opportunity to stay in this apartment after having been amazed by another of Yannis and Tax’s properties and deciding to extend my stay. This apartment is great and to be honest I’m almost hesitant to give it the stellar review it deserves because I want to keep the spot available for my future trips to Athens! <br/>Since the place has been very newly remodelled, everything is brand new, modern and clean. The decor is beautiful and the furniture very comfortable. The floor to ceiling windows in the main living area offer great city views day and night. The outdoor space is perfect for relaxing with the heated plunge pool (kept optimally warm and clean by Tax), I will definitely miss it. Aside from this, the apartment is well stocked, comes with the amount of towels you want (both bath and pool towels) and has plenty of hot water (not a given in Athens). <br/>The location is hard to beat as you are right downtown. The Acropolis museum and Acropolis “walk” are 5 mins away. From there, it takes an easy 10-15 mins to walk to Plaka and Syntagma (I would recommend taking the much more beautiful Acropolis walk to get there instead of the road that Google maps usually suggests that follows the highway). There are plenty of shops in the area as well as restaurants, cafes, pharmacies, etc.<br/>Yannis and Tax organized a very nice transfer for me from the airport and made sure that the check in and out processes went smoothly. They remained available, helpful and friendly throughout my stay and made sure that I had everything needed. Overall I consider my experience to have been positive on every level and I’m looking forward to going back!",5

The street was nice and quiet but the neighbourhood had everything we needed. <br/>Maria was very helpful and quick to respond. The place was clean and nicely furnished. We appreciated the Netlix and air conditioning. <br/>If I had to pick out one small negative, it would be the lack of natural light. The apartment is a basement suite with only one window opening to an enclosed courtyard. There was virtually no natural light, however, that is beyond the owners control.

Great location close to so much without being touristy. Busy area with a lot of local shops and necessities. Suggesting updated instructions on the washer\dryer for short, cold washes and better drying(not steaming.) Also, the recommendation guide is very long and meaty - I actually attempted to reorganize it to make it more readable and gave up after an hour.

Close enough to the central areas to walk (20-30 mins) or if you prefer use ubers for around 5-6 euros. Nice big balcony which we didn't use but would be great in warmer weather. Parking space is very handy. Rooms and especially the 2 bathrooms are a bit small and cramped, but this may be the norm in Athens. We had some maintenance issues (broken toilet seat, 2 bedroom door handles not working, 3 balcony doors and windows not locking) which were annoying but not the end of the world. Host did offer to send someone to fix these issues but we declined as we only had 2 days left. Wifi is not the fastest but adequate.

The space was extremely large, so would be perfect for people traveling in a group. The check in is NOT self check in, although it claims to be. You actually check in with the front desk and it requires formal paperwork as though you’re staying at a hotel. The bathroom shampoo and conditioner bottles were basically empty, it was almost like they filled them with an ounce so there was enough for one night’s stay. I didn’t love that there was a fridge that required payment for items inside of it, it’s better to leave it empty if that’s the case since there is no way to pay upon check out, especially because we were leaving extremely early.  Also notable that the building has an elevator but there are still stairs required to get to and from the elevator landing.  Important if you have lots of luggage or mobility issues.

This particular apartment was on the top floor, had a working elevator and was walking distance to the acropolis. <br/>Some things to be aware of:<br/>The area can be noisy. Not all rooms have ac so the rooms with single beds can be very warm (mid sept). Learn to use hot water in that it's not endless, and you will need to stagger showering in larger groups. <br/>Overall the apartment was perfect for what we needed.

Some things the hosts can’t control - unit is on 8th floor and elevators are extremely small, single door, old and sketchy.

The apartment itself was very clean and we felt very safe and comfortable. If you want PRIME location- it doesn’t get much better than this! Amazing shops, restaurants and historical sites are just footsteps away! And there are perfect photo opportunities at very turn.

As soon as we arrived, we saw a cross trainer machine stuck next to the sofa - not in the pictures. The shower is sadly woeful and not of the standard I expect for this rate. It is an old bath tap and I would have to use a spoon to operate the button that switched the water to the shower head. The shower head itself never fitted in its holder and would quite often fall off. A terrible experience. While the bed was very comfortable, the frame for the mattress is too high for it. It is therefore only suitable for very tall people. There are two wardrobes but only one coat hanger was provided, so pretty useless. The hosts did come to look at the shower but never did anything about it. We did receive a refund of 200 Euros off the amount for the week but the entire process was very stressful. No real local tips were provided so just as well we knew the area ourselves. Not recommended, sadly. Love the area though.",0

We didn’t need any assistance during our stay. But I felt asssured that we could count on her help should the need arise.<br/>It’s worth noting that the house is basically next to the metro. So you have trains passing by frequently. It’s quite loud when you’re sitting outside or have the windows open. This might bother you if you’re sensitive to noise or looking for a particularly quiet place to stay. It was no problem for us though, and we sat on the balcony every day.

Terrace view onto Acropolis is great - and can be very relaxing in the evening.<br/>The bad: this is not an owner-run place like nocarz was meant to be. It's managed like a hotel by a management crew, but unfortunately they don't have the skill to run it properly. <br/>I received no less than 7 automated reminders and check-in instructions prior to arriving, and when we finally got there, we discovered an apartment with an open door, some random people taking a shower there, garbage from previous guests in the kitchen and no linens on any bed.<br/>Shocking. Upon further investigation, turned out people taking a shower were neighbors in the apartment next door who arrived shortly before us and the key to their place was not even in the lockbox. They just came all the way from South Africa to run into a closed door and no key. With our apartment clearly vacated, they decided to take a quick shower because they had to leave for a show at Odeon shortly.<br/>So, two apartments that have not been cleaned, one missing a key and one wide open for anyone to use.<br/>Despite multiple messages through nocarz, nobody responds in chat - don't expect any responses. Luckily I had a Greek SIM card and was able to call. At 8 in the evening they picked up, apologized for the mix up and promised to try and get ahold of the cleaning crew. Knowing Greece I was not optimistic that anyone would indeed come late on a Saturday night and was prepared to search for a hotel.<br/>But, the crew did indeed come, rather frazzled - clearly some internal communications were broken. They did a quick clean and left fresh towels and bath accessories. Unfortunately, working in a hurry, they still left garbage in the kitchen and the linens were stained.<br/>We only stayed for one night transiting to the islands, so we didn't care as long as we had a place to spend the night. But if this were my primary stay in Athens, I would avoid at all costs.",4

It had two balconies, big TV perfectly positioned in front of the bed, good bed and the bathroom was very clean and nice. There is a street right outside and you could briefly hear the traffic, however it didn't bother me the slightest. Communication with the host was also excellent. At first I didn't get hot water to work so I wrote to the host. Within 30 minutes they responded and gave me clear instructions on how to turn on the heater, which was basically just a power switch.

It is within a few blocks of the Acropolis and there are great restaurants, coffee shops, a gelato house, and markets right outside your door. We honestly fell in love with the neighborhood, which made a couple of country dwellers long for the city. The bed could have been softer - I had a hard time getting good sleep; I also recommend putting in a shelf in the shower for holding soaps and such. Otherwise the privacy, the patio, the price, and again the neighborhood made some of the smaller imperfections totally tolerable. I do think a new bed and shower shelving would be great investments, though! Otherwise, boy oh boy, what a wonderful intro to Athens, Greece.

They consider the second bed in the living room (the pullout couch) an EXTRA AMENITY WITH AN EXTRA CHARGE. They make no mention of this anywhere on their listing or in their communication after booking. They listed the apt for up to 4 people with 2 beds. I booked with two people, with me in the bedroom and my friend on the pullout couch. When we checked in they tried to charge €135 extra to use the pullout. Again, NO MENTION OF THIS IN THEIR LISTING OR COMMUNICATION PRIOR, So it was deceitful and a scam.

Visited Akropolis, Ancient Agora and more, all on foot from the apartment. Host was communicative and accommodating. I’d super recommend. <br/>A few cons in my experience: Upon arrival, the flat wasn’t cleaned, so we had to go out and kill time while waiting for the cleaning lady.

It is right near Monastiraki Square (less than 5 min walk) I would like to emphasize how clean the apartment felt from the bathroom, shower, and bed. It felt like a nice hotel. There is free wifi. There are a couple codes you need to enter to get inside the apartment, so it feels very safe, even being very centrally located. There are plenty of shops nearby if you happen to forget to bring something. There is one queen bed and a sofa. The metro from the airport to the apartment is fairly easy even for being someone who hasn't used a metro that often. While in Athens, there was no need to use the metro because all the main sites were within walking distance. <br/> Amelie made the check-in process very easy and responded to my messages very quickly and gave me advice on how to get from airport to the apartment.<br/>This apartment is an incredible value for the price and would highly, highly recommend booking it for your stay.

No problem finding the address and checking in.<br/>Location, few minutes from Acropolis and Acropolis Museum and Acropoli metro station. Athens city center is not so big, so almost everywhere is in walking distance.<br/>The apartment is very well decorated with an amazing Acropolis view. Spotless clean. Comfortable beds. Very well sound isolated, almost silent although the apartment is located on one of the main avenues in Athens.  The only thing you may complain may be the size of elevator. It is small (only for two people). But this doesn't change my opinion of our stay: Perfect!",5

The apartment is a comfortable walk to the Acropolis metro, Plaka, Monastiraki and the Acropolis itself, a very good location for visitors. The neighbourhood is a bit run down but it felt very safe with taxis and public transport close by. <br/>The apartment itself was lovely, spacious, good bathroom, wrap around balcony and well equipped for three ladies. A nice spot to come home to after a tiring day sightseeing. <br/>Our host was fabulous, very quick to respond and offer assistance when needed. <br/>We would happily come back here.",5

Παράλληλα, η πόρτα του μπάνιου ήταν συρόμενη, και έτσι, ακόμα και με την πόρτα κλειστή, η μυρωδιά στο σπίτι ηταν ανυπόφορη. Επίσης, η τοποθέτηση 2 ραφιων πάνω από την κεφαλή του κρεβατιού είναι πολύ επικίνδυνη. Είναι ανεύθυνο σε μια πόλη που γίνονται σεισμοί, να βάζεις το ντεκόρ πάνω από την ασφάλεια του επισκέπτη.",2

For shorter stays I think you’d pretty much get what you expect. Very small kitchen,even bumped my head a few times, small bathroom (not 100% clean).. but the bed was very comfortable and TV a nice addition. I would recommend Oltian to get different, warmer lighting since the white was almost unbearable and not cozy at all, felt like being at a hospital or dentist. One very obvious plus side is the balcony, which is quite spacious and lovely, I can imagine especially in summer. Finally, I know the location receives a bunch of criticism in the reviews, but personally I found it quite nice. Very close to the center and bunch of cheap restaurants, shops… If you want to not be confronted with the raw reality of a big city, then stay at a 5-star hotel by the Akropolis.

This could have been communicated to us instead of us having to arrive to a locked door. we had also travelled since very early in the morning and it couldn't be 3pm soon enough so we could get a little nap in our b&b. the 40 minutes spent on the stairs outside the apartment were not ideal after only 2 hours of sleep the night prior. the room was very clean and comfortable, the location a little bit noisy since there'slive music every night at the square not far from the building.

I found a cockroach probably from the street and the hosts sent asap a cleaner.<br/>Cons<br/>Stairs are really not well lit. Even if there s a well functionning lift, its not very safe. In Greece you need to turn a fuse on for hot water, but this is the only place i ve been with a timer. So you cannot leave the fuse on. You always have to turn it on 10 min before, if you want hot water, and it turns quickly lukewarm. Same you cannot charge devices when you leave the place, as the power turns out when you leave. Walls were also not really noise proof so you could easily hear action in other rooms.",4

As far as I understand, they only see their staying guests as money. I hope they will be more respectful towards other guests.",0

Only 2 toilet papers were left in the apartment for a 9 nights stay for a family of 4. Old and damaged kitchen tools. There is a pan ready to be thrown away in the garbage and not for use. Windows very dirty and wall paint damaged especially in the bathroom due to humidity. We had to clean the closets in order to place our clothes. Furniture not stable, especially the chairs and the sofa was other than the one in the photos. Other than that, there are great restaurants nearby and a railway station which takes you in no time to the city centre.

The flat was extremely clean and well-maintained, which made for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The location of the flat was also perfect, as it was very central and close to all the major attractions in the area.<br/>One of the highlights of our stay was the host, Antonios.

I loved that I could hear a train whistling somewhere far! Made me mind-travel! Commuting around was super easy and walking to the metro and back was nothing but a short stroll. I wish we had more time there, however, we are going back the soonest! Alexandra was so kind and willing! She was always there for us, answered all of our questions and was happy to provide more than we asked! Big applause to this hostess and this exceptionally beautiful house! I cannot but strongly recommend this piece of a gem! Totally worth it!",5

Also near Nea Smyrni 'plah-tee-ah' (square), a popular dining and shopping destination. <br/>The apartment itself has a youthful vibe and almost anything you could ask for. There is a big screen TV in the living room, plus a smaller one in the upstairs bedroom, which also has a private balcony, in addition to the huge balcony off the living room. Both feature an unobstructed view of the Acropolis!<br/>Water pressure in both the bathroom and kitchen was good. No annoying leaks, drips or sounds.

All in all, an excellent value for someone looking to be close to the action, but not necessarily in the thick of it.",5

To begin with, it’s located in the heart of the city, amazing restaurants are bar right around the corner. <br/>To be honest, I was a little skeptical that it’s on top of a parking lot, however it’s TOTALLY worth the view. Extremely safe, very friendly staff with both women and men always present to make you feel safe and welcoming. Dimitri, our host was amazing, helped us with amazing recommendations. They welcomed us with some complimentary wine, and had a loaded fridge with snacks and drinks all on the house. <br/>The cleanliness is impeccable, they cleaned the bnb every day during our 4 day stay. <br/>And of course, the view. You can get the best angle of the acropolis along with the entirety of the city. <br/>This is a hidden gem, we’re glad we found this. <br/>Thanks so much for your hospitality!",5

The area was accessible with a good bus connection and taxis. There were also a couple really nice restaurants nearby which were walkable and had fantastic food.

As cool as it is to have your location in the city centre, the location of this nocarz is the worst. The room is in the first floor of a building, where the ground floor is a bar with extremely loud music every day of the week! Right next to this bar, there is an even louder bar, where people dance, shout, scream and laugh until 4 or 5am. Every night. The house is quite old, so if you are laying in your bed it doesn't only feel like you're at the party - you actually are at the party. It was impossible to sleep even with ear plugs or noise cancelling airpods. So either plan your sleep cycle accordinglyt to 5am - 8am, because at 8am the noisy street starts to do its job.

That means 4 people can never shower at the same time, Not to mention filling the pool with hot water which is ⅛ full and then there is already cold water, In addition, the electricity went out a few times. This is an old building that has been upgraded. It is not possible to apply too heavy a load on the electricity. And as for the doors, they are all made of glass, although they look nice, but there is no privacy, they cannot be locked in the toilet and bathroom.<br/>One more little thing, It's a shame that the host didn't bring more tissue paper, linens and towels, it felt lacking. there are also a security issue.",3

Le quartier semble également peu sûr la nuit. La baignoire présente des inconvénients, mettant deux heures pour se remplir d'eau chaude (système de chauffe-eau), ce qui est excessif. Malgré la réactivité de Viktor, son implication est limitée. Les demandes d'informations sur les recommandations locales, les transports, notamment le moyen le plus rapide pour rejoindre le centre d'Athènes et acheter des billets, ont été renvoyées à G-Maps sans réelle assistance.

First, we didn't get the instructions of how to get in and we had to wait for 2 hours in front of the flat, as the owner was not replying to our messages.  After we got in, we noticed that lots of furniture is broken. The worst was a glass table in the kitchen with only 3 legs which fell on us when we touched it. The wifi and the kettle didn't work. After our complaint to nocarz the company sent a technician and the table and wifi got repaired. Unfortunately, later I got bitten by some insects, most probably bed bugs (I was sleeping on a couch bed). My arms were all covered in red spots in lines. It could not have been mosquitoes as I don't get a reaction like this, also we kept windows closed. I made another complain to nocarz, unfortunately I couldn't get a partial refund because I couldn't find the actual insects. I visited a doctor and he prescribed antibiotics.

I found the hosts rude as their response was ""we've never had this problem before"" instead of oh I am so sorry you are having trouble, let me help. I also was annoyed because I asked for an early check in, and they allowed me to drop off luggage but insisted the keys must be in the lockbox for the cleaning lady to come before my 3PM check in. When I left my luggage, the place was clean and ready, and I still had to wait to check in for whatever reason.

Omonoia is known for being a dodgy area but I would argue that the masses of danger that has been alluded to before is not extraordinarily riskier here than in areas elsewhere in the city, the main square has clearly been built up very recently and there are always people around. I would say that the building itself is not the nicest, not well lit (especially where the penthouse room is) and the entrance to the building sometimes had homeless people blocking the door to get in at night which felt uncomfortable, but manageable.

We arrived and they told us they needed another hour or so to finish cleaning. The places still smelled so bad of cigarettes that we could not possibly stay there anymore because there was no way to air out the place fast enough. We canceled not even worried about getting money back and just re booked. The cleaning lady was very kind and we knew she would do a good job cleaning but cigarette smells are hard to get rid of.
